5. First Usage – Quick Start
5.1 Connectors – Controls – Display
The top of the Babyface Pro features a hi-precision rotary encoder, 6 buttons, 4 LED bands and
6 status LEDs.
The four LED bands show the current gain, the input and output level, and the channel to be
set, all dependent on the current mode. The lowest LEDs signal phantom power (+48 V, orange)
and DIM, the highest one overload (clip, red).
The rotary encoder is used to change various parameters directly at the unit. The 4 buttons IN,
A (SET), (MIX) B and OUT directly access the respective function.
IN gives access to Gain control and phantom
power. Press IN several times to step through
the inputs 1/2, 3/4 and Optical (SPDIF/ADAT).
Press SELECT several times to step through left,
right or both channels, as indicated by flashing
LEDs. Then turn the wheel to change the gain, or
press SET to activate phantom power (only in
stand-alone mode). Phantom power is signalled
by two orange LEDs at the bottom of meters 1
and 2.
OUT gives access to the output volume control.
Press OUT several times to step through the
outputs 1/2, Phones and Optical (SPDIF/ADAT).
Then turn the wheel to change the level. To
change the output balance press and hold
SELECT before turning the wheel.
DIM activates Dim for the Main Out as defined in
TotalMix FX.
The input LED Opt also serves as synchronisa-
tion indicator for the digital input. It stays yellow
when the input is selected but has no input signal
(No Lock). It flashes green when the signal has
been detected but is not fully synchronous
(Lock). When in Sync, the color changes to a
constant green. See also chapter 9.9 / 16.2,
Clock Modes - Synchronisation.
The button DIM is also used for Recall, to load a specific listening volume for the Main Out that
can be defined in TotalMix FX. Pushing the knob SET for 2 seconds when OUT is selected
stores the current setting. If the volume (output level) had been changed pressing DIM for two
seconds will restore the former value.
The right side of the Babyface Pro has two instrument/line inputs and two headphone outputs.
The analog inputs 3/4 are high impedance, unbal-
anced multi-purpose inputs with TS jacks. They
include 9 dB fine digital gain control, and a choice of
+4 dBu or -10 dBV reference level, controlled from
the Tools menu of input channels 3 and 4 in To-
talMix FX.

!
The output channels 3/4 feed two Phones outputs via two independent driver circuits, optimized
for high (TRS 1/4”, 6.35mm) and low impedance (TRS 1/8”, 3.5mm) headphones. Their unbal-
anced output signal is – in terms of quality – identical to the ones at the XLR line outputs, but
lower in level.
In case the phones output is to be used as line output an adapter TRS plug to RCA phono plugs,
or TRS plug to two TS plugs is required. More on cable codes and pinouts can be found in chap-
ter 29.2.
The back of the unit has the XLR inputs and outputs of channels 1/2.
The short circuit protected, low impedance XLR line outputs do not operate servo bal-
anced! When connecting unbalanced equipment, make sure pin 3 of the XLR output is not
connected. A connection to ground might cause a decreased THD (higher distortion) and
increased power consumption!
The Babyface Pro has two analog microphone inputs that can operate as line inputs with levels
up to +19 dBu, when set to 0 dB gain and PAD active. The electronic input stage uses a servo
balanced design which handles unbalanced and balanced signals correctly, automatically adjust-
ing the level reference.
When using unbalanced cables with the XLR inputs pin 3 of the XLR jack should be con-
nected to ground. Otherwise noise may occur, caused by the unconnected negative input of
the balanced input.
The left side of the Babyface
Pro has an optical input and
output, a power supply con-
nector, a USB socket and a 6-
pin MINI DIN connector for the
included MIDI breakout cable.
Optical I/O (TOSLINK): The
unit automatically detects SPDIF or ADAT input signals. The optical output can operate as ADAT
or SPDIF output, depending on the current setting in the Settings dialog.
USB 2.0: Standard USB socket for connection to the computer. Please make sure the Babyface
Pro can have the full voltage/current delivered from the computer by using hi-quality USB cables
(like the one included), no USB extension cables and no USB hubs. When connected to USB 3
only the USB 2 protocol will be used.
Socket for power connection. Unburdens the computer’s power supply, or ensures a stable
power supply, in case it proves to be insufficient when taken from the computer. This socket
supports locking type jacks as found on the optional RME DC power supply. After inserting the
connector carefully turn it by 90° so that it locks.
User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME 9
5.2 Quick Start
After the driver installation (chapter 7 / 15), connect the inputs to the analog signal source.
The analog input sensitivity can be changed at the unit (IN, SELECT) or in TotalMix FX (Tools,
Gain). To achieve the best signal to noise ratio, adjust your analog source to its highest output
level and then decrease the input gain in TotalMix or at the Babyface itself to make sure that the
loudest signal reaches about -3dBFS.
The XLR line inputs of the Babyface Pro can be used with +4 dBu and -10 dBV line signals. The
electronic input stage can handle balanced (XLR, TRS jacks) and unbalanced (TS jacks) input
signals correctly.
On the analog playback side (the DA side), an adjustment of the analog output level is available
by the rotary encoder (select desired output via OUT), or in TotalMix FX.
The output signal of channels 3/4, Phones, can be set freely using the rotary encoder. These
outputs are optimized for headphones, but can also be used as line outputs.
The Babyface Pro digital inputs and output support the formats SPDIF and ADAT optical.
TotalMix FX remembers all settings, and loads these automatically when the Babyface Pro driv-
ers are loaded.
5.3. Operation at the Unit
Operation at the unit in online mode (drivers installed under Windows and Mac OS X, PC mode
chosen at the unit) covers the most useful actions and situations in daily operation. Clearly la-
belled buttons together with an intuitive operation scheme give direct access to volume, monitor-
ing and setup.
Input Gains
The gains of all four analog inputs can be controlled directly by the big encoder knob. Use IN to
select input 1/2 or 3/4, then push SELECT several times to step through left channel, right chan-
nel or both. The selected channel and amount of gain is shown by a single LED flashing in the
left INPUT level meters. Turn the wheel to increase or decrease the gain. The three INPUT
LEDs also show overload. Too hot levels will not be missed even if the level meter currently
shows a quieter channel.
Output Volume
Select one of the three outputs via OUT, then turn the wheel. The current fader position of To-
talMix FX (which moves in sync) is displayed via flashing single LEDs in the output level meter.
The three output LEDs also show overload. Too hot levels will not be missed even if the level
meter currently shows a quieter channel.
0 dB position: reduce the gain so that the yellow LED just turns off.
OUT can also be reassigned to perform Speaker B switching in the Options/Key Commands
dialog in TotalMix FX.
Output Balance
Select one of the three outputs via OUT, then hold down SELECT. The right level meters show
two bars, lit up until the yellow LEDs. Turn the wheel to move the stereo image more to the left
or right. This setting equals an adjustment of the PAN knob in a stereo hardware output of To-
talMix FX, and indeed the knob in the software will move in sync.
10 User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME
DIM
Works on the hardware output defined as Main Output in TotalMix FX. Therefore the DIM LEDs
will not be lit when stepping through the other two outputs. The applied attenuation is the one
defined in TotalMix FX. DIM can also be used as hotkey for many other actions, among the
switching to Speaker B or Talkback. Use the Options/Key Commands dialog in TotalMix FX to
assign one of them to DIM.
Recall
Pushing DIM for two seconds sets the Main output volume to the value formerly saved for Re-
call. The Recall value can also be set directly at the unit by holding SET down for two seconds.
Monitoring – MIX
Additionally to the extensive routing and mixing options in TotalMix FX, which provide perfect
monitoring solutions, the monitoring level of all three input sources to all three output destina-
tions can be controlled directly at the unit. No need to grab the mouse and bring TM FX into the
foreground! Operation is easy and logical:
 Use OUT to select the output for the monitoring, i.e. where the signal will be routed to
 Use IN to select the input with the signal that should be monitored
 Push MIX. The input level LEDs start to flash
 Use SELECT to choose between left, right or both channels
 Turn the encoder to set the actual monitoring level
While the setup is simplified (no panorama available) it is still very efficient and will address most
needs. Note that direct control covers only channels 1/2 from ADAT.
TotalMix FX in Submix view (default) will highlight the currently selected submix and move the
corresponding input fader in sync with the Babyface Pro, so that the ongoing process can be
controlled and followed easily at the screen. This helps in setup and understanding of the moni-
toring function.
Switch digital output format (SPDIF <> ADAT)
Use OUT to select the optical output (Opt.). Push SET. The level meter will signal ADAT mode
with 8 LEDs, SPDIF mode with 2 LEDs turned on. Use SELECT to switch between them. This
setting is also available in the driver’s Settings dialog.
In stand-alone mode with the input Opt currently active the left level meters will show the status
of the incoming optical signal in the same way, on the left level meters.
Hotkeys A (SET) and B (MIX)
In online mode SET and MIX have only one function each (setting the Recall volume and start-
ing the direct monitoring control). Both functions are also available in TotalMix FX at the com-
puter, but both buttons can be reconfigured (like DIM) to perform many other functions, like
Talkback, global mute, Mono, External Input, changing Snapshots and Channel Layouts and
more. Just select the function that suits your personal workflow best.
LED Brightness
Default brightness is 25%. The LEDs can be changed to 50% and 100% brightness, where
100% obviously will cause a higher power consumption. This might be useful in daylight condi-
tions. The difference between 25% and 100% is 0.5 Watts or 100 mA higher load at 5V bus
power with all LEDs lit. To step through the three brightness states hold down SELECT and
push IN several times.

6. Hardware Installation
To simplify installation it is recommended to first install the drivers before the unit is connected to
the computer. But it will also work the other way round.
In case the level meters of the Babyface Pro show CC during power-on: the unit is in Class
Compliance mode and will not work under Windows. Remove the USB cable, hold SELECT
and DIM button down, plug-in the USB cable or the power supply. This procedure changes be-
tween CC and normal mode. When the LED Level meters change to PC the normal mode is
active.
When using a power supply (stand-alone mode), holding down SELECT and DIM for more than
two seconds repeatedly changes between PC and CC. Note that changing the operating mode
is not supported during normal USB operation, so any USB connection has to be removed.
Chapter 28.3 explains how to find the ideal USB port.
7. Driver and Firmware
7.1 Driver Installation
RME is constantly updating their drivers, and modern computers mostly do not have a CD drive
anymore. Therefore please download the drivers from the RME website at http://rme.to/usbe.
Unzip the downloaded file and start the driver installation with rmeinstaller.exe.
Start rmeinstaller.exe and follow the instructions of the installer. After installation connect com-
puter and Babyface Pro. Windows detects the new hardware as Babyface Pro and installs the
drivers automatically.
After a reboot, the icons of TotalMix FX and Settings dialog appear in
the notification area. Windows might hide them behind the triangle,
click on it to access them and to configure their appearance.
Driver Updates do not require to remove the existing drivers. Simply install the new driver over
the existing one.
Possible reasons why a Babyface Pro is not found automatically:
 The Babyface Pro is in Class Compliant mode. See above.
 The USB port is not active in the system (check the Device Manager)
 The USB cable is not, or not correctly inserted into the socket
 The Babyface Pro does not receive any or not enough power. Remove current-consuming
hard drives from nearby ports. Avoid USB extension cables and USB hubs. Use an external
power supply, any standard one delivering 9 - 14 V DC with at least 1 A will work. The con-
nector needs to have – outside, + inside.
User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME 13
7.2 De-installing the Drivers
A de-installation of the driver files is not necessary. Thanks to full Plug & Play support, the driver
files will not be loaded after the hardware has been removed.
Unfortunately Windows Plug & Play methods do not cover the additional autorun entries of To-
talMix, the Settings dialog, and the registration of the ASIO driver. These entries can be re-
moved from the registry by a software de-installation request. This request can be found (like all
de-installation entries) in Control Panel, Programs and Features (XP: Add or Remove Pro-
grams). Click on the entry 'RME Fireface USB'. Here it is also possible to remove the driver it-
self. Select Windows Driver Package – RME Fireface USB, then Uninstall.
7.3 Firmware Update
The Flash Update Tool updates the firmware of the Babyface Pro to the latest version. It re-
quires an already installed driver. Please download the FUT from the RME website at
http://rme.to/usbe.
Unzip the downloaded file and start the firmware update with fut
_
usb.exe. The Flash Update
Tool displays the current revision of the Babyface Pro's firmware, and whether it needs an up-
date or not. If so, then simply press the 'Update' button. A progress bar will indicate when the
flash process is finished (Verify Ok).
After the update the Babyface Pro needs to be reset. This is done by powering down the Baby-
face Pro for 5 seconds. A reboot of the computer is not necessary.
When the update unexpectedly fails (status: failure), the unit's Safety BIOS will be used from the
next boot on, the unit stays fully functional. The flash process should then be tried again.

8. Configuring the Babyface Pro
8.1 Settings Dialog - General
Configuration of the Babyface Pro is done via its own settings dialog. The panel 'Settings' can be
opened:
 by clicking on the fire symbol in the Task Bar's notification area
The mixer of the Babyface Pro (TotalMix FX) can be opened:
 by clicking on the FX symbol in the Task Bar's notification area
The hardware of the Babyface Pro offers a number of helpful, well thought-out practical func-
tions and options which affect how the card operates. The following is available in the Settings
dialog:
 Latency
 Configuration of the digital I/O
 Current sample rate
 Synchronization behaviour
 State of input and output
Any changes made in the Settings
dialog are applied immediately -
confirmation (e.g. by clicking on
OK or exiting the dialog) is not
required.
However, settings should not be
changed during playback or record
if it can be avoided, as this can
cause unwanted noises.
Also, please note that even in
'Stop' mode, several programs
keep the recording and playback
devices active, which means that
any new settings might not be
applied immediately.
The tab About includes infor-
mation about the current driver
and firmware version plus three
more options:
Lock Registry
Default: off. Checking this option brings up a dialog to enter a password. Changes in the Set-
tings dialog are no longer written to the registry. As the settings are always loaded from the reg-
istry when starting the computer, this method provides an easy way to define an initial state for
the Babyface Pro.
Enable MMCSS for ASIO activates support with higher priority for the ASIO driver. Note: At this
time, activating this option seems to be useful only with the latest Cubase/Nuendo at higher
load. With other software this option can decrease performance. The change becomes active
after an ASIO reset. Therefore it is easy to quickly check which setting works better.
Sort ASIO Devices
Changes the order only of the ASIO channels when using more than one interface.
User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME 15
Buffer Size
The setting Buffer Size determines the latency between incoming and outgoing ASIO and WDM
data, as well as affecting system stability (see chapter 9.1 / 10).
Errors does not refer to buffer errors, but USB transmission errors. The display will be reset on
any start of a playback/record. More information can be found in chapter 28.3.
Options
DSP – EQ for Record
Switches the 3-band EQ and Low Cut of all input channels into the recording path. In case
Loopback has been activated the EQ and Low Cut of the Output channel is also placed into the
recording path. See also chapter 23.6.
Optical Out
The optical TOSLINK output can operate as ADAT or SPDIF output. The Channel Status is fixed
to Consumer state.
Note: The optical input detects the incoming format automatically.
SPDIF In
TMS activates the transmission of Channel Status data and Track Marker information from the
SPDIF input signal to a software that supports receiving it. If not needed this option should be
turned off.
WDM Devices
Reduce the number of WDM devices to the ones really needed to improve performance of the
operating system.
Clock Mode
Sample Rate
Sets the currently used sample rate. Offers a central and comfortable way of configuring the
sample rate of all WDM devices to the same value, as since Vista the audio software is no long-
er allowed to set the sample rate. However, an ASIO program can still set the sample rate by
itself.
During record/playback the selection is greyed out, so no change is possible.
Clock Source
The unit can be configured to use its own clock (Internal = Master) or the digital input signal (Op-
tical = Slave). If the external source isn't available (Input Status No Lock), the unit will change to
the internal clock. The current clock source is displayed as Current.
Pitch
More information on Pitch is available in chapter 8.2.
Input Status
Indicates presence of a valid signal at the optical input (Lock, No Lock) and whether the signal is
synchronous (Sync). The third column shows the sample frequency detected by the hardware
(coarse recognition, 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz etc.). In Clock Mode the clock reference is shown.
See also chapter 28.1.

8.2 Settings Dialog - Pitch
Usually soundcards and audio interfaces generate their internal clock (master mode) by a
quartz. Therefore the internal clock can be set to 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz, but not to a value in be-
tween. SteadyClock, RME's sensational Low Jitter Clock System, is based on a Direct Digital
Synthesizer (DDS). This superior circuitry can generate nearly any frequency with highest preci-
sion.
DDS has been implemented into the Babyface Pro with regard to the needs of professional vid-
eo applications, as well as to maximum flexibility. The section Pitch includes both a list of typical
video frequencies (so called pull up/pull down at 0.1% and 4%) and a fader to freely change the
basic sample rate in steps of 1 Hz (!) over a range of +/- 5%.
The Pitch function requires the Babyface Pro to be in clock mode Master (Internal)! The
frequency setting will only be applied to this one specific Babyface Pro!
Changing the sample rate during record/playback often results in a loss of audio, or brings
up warning messages of the audio software. Therefore the desired sample rate should be
set at least coarsely before starting the software.
Coarse
Coarse modification in steps of 50 Hz
is done by clicking with the mouse to
the left and right of the fader knob.
Fine
Fine modification in steps of 1 Hz is
done by using the left/right cursor
keys.
Reset
Ctrl key plus left mouse click.
Application examples
Pitch allows for a simultaneous change of speed and tune during record and playback. From
alignment to other sources up to creative effects – everything is possible.
Pitch enables you to intentionally de-tune the complete DAW. This way, the DAW can match
instruments which have a wrong or unchangeable tuning.
Pitch allows for the change of the sample rate of all WDM devices at the same time. Since Vista
this is no longer possible via the audio program, thus requires a manual reconfiguration of all
WDM devices. Changing the sample rate from the Settings dialog solves this problem. As the
change within the system requires some time, record/playback should not be started immediate-
ly, but only after at least 5 seconds after a change.
Tip: the current CPU load can be used to determine if the audio subsystem has finished the re-
configuration.

9. Operation and Usage
9.1 Playback
In the audio application being used, Babyface Pro must be selected as output device. It can
often be found in the Options, Preferences or Settings menus, as Playback Device, Audio De-
vices, Audio etc.
We recommend switching all system sounds off (via >Control Panel /Sound<). Also Babyface
Pro should not be the Preferred Device for playback, as this could cause loss of synchronization
and unwanted noises. If you feel you cannot do without system sounds, you should consider
using the on-board sound device or buying a cheap Blaster clone and select this as Preferred
Device in >Control Panel /Multimedia /Audio< or >Control Panel /Sound /Playback<
.
The screenshot shows a typical configuration dialog. After selecting a device, audio data is sent
to an analog or digital port, depending on which has been selected as playback device.
In- creas-
ing the
num-
ber and/or
size of
au- dio
buff- ers
may prevent the audio signal from breaking up, but also increases latency i.e. output is delayed.
For synchronized playback of audio and MIDI (or similar), be sure to activate the checkbox ‘Get
position from audio driver’.
Note: Since Vista the audio application can no longer control the sample rate under WDM.
Therefore the driver of the Babyface Pro includes a way to set the sample rate globally for all
WDM devices within the Settings dialog, see chapter 8.1.

9.2 DVD-Playback (AC-3/DTS)
AC-3 / DTS
When using popular DVD software players like WinDVD and PowerDVD, their audio data stream
can be sent to any AC-3/DTS capable receiver using the Babyface Pro's SPDIF output. For this
to work, the WDM SPDIF device of the Babyface Pro has to be selected in >Control Panel/
Sounds and Multimedia/ Audio< or >Control Panel/ Sound/Playback<. Also check 'use preferred
device only'.
The DVD software's audio properties now show the options 'SPDIF Out' or similar. When select-
ing it, the software will transfer the non-decoded digital multichannel data stream to the Baby-
face Pro.
Note: This 'SPDIF' signal sounds like chopped noise at highest level. Try to avoid mixing and
routing the signal to your loudspeakers, as they might get damaged.
Multichannel
PowerDVD and WinDVD can also operate as software decoder, sending a DVD's multichannel
data stream directly to the analog outputs of the Babyface Pro. For this to work select the WDM
playback device ’Loudspeaker’ of the Babyface Pro in
XP: >Control Panel/ Sounds and Multimedia/ Audio<, and check 'Use only default devices'. Addi-
tionally the loudspeaker setup, found under >Volume/ Speaker Settings/ Advanced< has to be
changed from Stereo to 5.1 Surround.
Since Vista: >Control Panel/ Sound/ Playback < as ‘Standard’. Additionally the loudspeaker
setup, found under >Configuration<, has to be changed from Stereo to 5.1 Surround.
PowerDVD's and WinDVD's audio properties now list several multichannel modes. If one of
these is selected, the software sends the decoded analog multichannel data to the Babyface
Pro. TotalMix can then be used to play back via any desired output channels.
The typical channel assignment for surround playback is:
1 - Left
2 - Right
3 - Center
4 - LFE (Low Frequency Effects)
5 - SL (Surround Left)
6 - SR (Surround Right)
Note 1: Selecting the Babyface Pro to be used as system playback device is against our rec-
ommendations, as professional interfaces should not be disturbed by system events. Make sure
to re-assign the selection after usage or to disable any system sounds (tab Sounds, scheme 'No
audio').
Note 2: The DVD player will be synced backwards from the Babyface Pro. This means when
using AutoSync and/or word clock, the playback speed and pitch follows the incoming clock
signal.

9.3 Notes on WDM
The driver offers one WDM streaming device per stereo pair, like Analog 3+4 (Babyface Pro).
WDM Streaming is Microsoft's current driver and audio system, directly embedded into the op-
erating system. WDM Streaming is hardly usable for professional music purposes, as all data is
processed by the so called Kernel Mixer, causing a latency of at least 30 ms. Additionally, WDM
can perform sample rate conversions unnoticed, cause offsets between record and playback
data, block channels unintentionally and much more.
Several programs do not offer any direct device selection. Instead they use the playback device
selected in Windows under
XP: <Control Panel/ Sounds and Multimedia/ Audio>
Since Vista: <Control Panel/ Sound/ Playback>
The program Sonar from Cakewalk is unique, as it offers to use the so called WDM Kernel
Streaming, bypassing the WDM mixer, thus achieving a similar performance to ASIO. In Win-
dows 7 and 10 using WASAPI also bypasses the WDM mixer.
Multi-Channel using WDM
The WDM Streaming device Loudspeaker (Analog 1+2) of the RME driver can operate as usual
stereo device, or as up to 8-channel device.
An 8-channel playback using the Windows Media Player requires the speaker setup 7.1 Sur-
round. Configure as follows:
XP: >Control Panel /Sounds and Multimedia /Audio /Volume /Speaker Settings /Advanced <
Since Vista: >Control Panel /Sound /Playback /Loudspeaker /Configure <
20 User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME
9.4 Channel Count under WDM
The Babyface Pro’s ADAT optical interface offers sample rates of up to 192 kHz using a stand-
ard ADAT recorder. For this to work single-channel data is spread to two or four ADAT channels
using the Sample Multiplexing technique. This reduces the number of available ADAT channels
from 8 to 4 or 2 per ADAT port.
Whenever the Babyface Pro changes into Double Speed (88.2/96 kHz) or Quad Speed mode
(176.4/192 kHz) all devices no longer available vanish automatically.
WDM Stereo device Double Speed Quad Speed
Babyface Pro Analog (1+2) Babyface Pro Analog (1+2) Babyface Pro Analog (1+2)
Babyface Pro Analog (3+4) Babyface Pro Analog (3+4) Babyface Pro Analog (3+4)
Babyface Pro AS (1+2) Babyface Pro AS (1+2) Babyface Pro AS (1+2)
Babyface Pro ADAT (3+4) Babyface Pro ADAT (3+4) Babyface Pro ADAT (3+4)
Babyface Pro ADAT (5+6) Babyface Pro ADAT (5+6) Babyface Pro ADAT (5+6)
Babyface Pro ADAT (7+8) Babyface Pro ADAT (7+8) Babyface Pro ADAT (7+8)
Note: Since Vista the analog outputs 1/2 show up as Loudspeaker.
9.5 Multi-client Operation
RME audio interfaces support multi-client operation. Several programs can be used at the same
time. The formats ASIO and WDM can even be used on the same playback channels simulta-
neously. As WDM uses a real-time sample rate conversion (ASIO does not), all active ASIO
software has to use the same sample rate.
However, a better overview is maintained by using the channels exclusively. This is no limitation
at all, because TotalMix allows for any output routing, and therefore a playback of multiple soft-
ware on the same hardware outputs.
Inputs can be used from an unlimited number of WDM and ASIO software at the same time, as
the driver simply sends the data to all applications simultaneously.
RME's sophisticated tool DIGICheck operates like an ASIO host, using a special technique to
access playback channels directly. Therefore DIGICheck is able to analyse and display playback
data from any software, no matter which format it uses.
User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME 21
9.6 Analog Recording
For recordings via the analog inputs the corresponding record device has to be chosen (Baby-
face Pro Analog (x+x)).
Channels 1 and 2 of the Babyface Pro have digitally controlled micro-
phone preamps of the highest quality. The digital control offers a gain
setting in steps of 1 dB within a range of 0 dB to +65 dB. The configura-
tion is done either directly at the unit via the rotary encoder, or via the
Settings panel of the input channels 1 and 2 in TotalMix, with the knob
Gain. The current gain is displayed in dB beside the knob.
Additionally a PAD can attenuate the input signal by 11 dB, to prevent
overloads by hard driven microphones or high level line signals. This
useful feature extends the gain range and increases the maximum input
level from +8 dBu up to +19 dBu at the XLR input.
Above the knob Gain the inputs can be set separately to provide 48V
phantom power at the XLR sockets. Phantom power is required for con-
denser microphones.
Input channels 3 and 4 are found as TS jacks on the right side of the Babyface Pro. These Hi-Z
universal inputs have an input impedance of 1 MOhm. The input gain is controlled and per-
formed digitally and limited to 9 dB. An additional hardware-based reference level optimizes the
signal to noise ratio. Choices are +4 dBu and -10 dBV.
It often makes sense to monitor the input signal or send it directly to the output. This can be
done at zero latency using TotalMix FX (see chapter 21).
An automated control of real-time monitoring can be achieved by Steinberg’s ASIO protocol with
RME’s ASIO drivers and any ASIO 2.0 compatible program. When 'ASIO Direct Monitoring' has
been switched on, the input signal is routed in real-time to the output whenever a recording is
started (punch-in).
9.7 Digital Recording
Unlike analog soundcards which produce empty wave files (or noise) when no input signal is
present, digital interfaces always need a valid input signal to start recording.
Taking this into account, RME added a com-
prehensive I/O signal status display to the
Babyface Pro, showing sample frequency,
lock and sync status in the Settings dialog,
and a status LED directly at the unit.
The sample frequency shown in the Settings
dialog is useful as a quick display of the cur-
rent configuration of the unit and the connect-
ed external equipment. If no sample frequen-
cy is recognized, it will read ‘No Lock’.
This way, configuring any suitable audio application for digital recording is simple. After connec-
tion the Babyface Pro displays the current and external sample frequency. This parameter can
then be changed in the application’s audio attributes (or similar) dialog.
22 User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME
9.8 Digital Connections
ADAT
The ADAT optical input of the Babyface Pro is fully compatible with all ADAT optical outputs.
RME's unsurpassed Bitclock PLL prevents clicks and drop outs even in extreme varipitch opera-
tion, and guarantees a fast and low jitter lock to the digital input signal. A usual TOSLINK cable
is sufficient for connection. More information on Double Speed (S/MUX) can be found in chapter
28.4.
ADAT In
Interface for a device sending an ADAT signal to the Babyface Pro. Carries the channels 1 to 8.
When receiving a Double Speed signal, this input carries the channels 1 to 4, at Quad Speed
the inputs 1 and 2.
ADAT Out
Interface for a device receiving an ADAT signal from the Babyface Pro. Transmits channels 1 to
8. When sending a Double Speed signal, this port carries channels 1 to 4, at Quad Speed the
channels 1 and 2.
Note: To use the optical output as ADAT port set the option Optical to ADAT in the Settings dia-
log.
SPDIF
The optical input automatically switches to SPDIF operation when such a signal is detected. The
audio information is then shown in TotalMix on the first two ADAT channels, AS 1 and AS 2.
Activating the option TMS in the Windows Settings dialog enables RME’s DIGICheck to analyze
the Channel Status of the input signal.
To send out SPDIF from the optical output, select the option Optical – SPDIF in the Settings
dialog. The output signal in TotalMix has to be present on the first ADAT channels, AS 1+2.
MIDI
Babyface Pro offers one MIDI I/O via two 5-pin DIN jacks. The MIDI ports are added to the sys-
tem by the driver. Using MIDI capable software, these ports can be accessed under the name
Babyface Pro Midi. Using more than one Babyface Pro, the operating system adds a consecu-
tive number to the port name, like Babyface Pro MIDI (2) etc.
The MIDI ports support multi-client operation. A MIDI input signal can be received by several
programs at the same time. Even the MIDI output can be used by multiple programs simultane-
ously. However, due to the limited bandwidth of MIDI, this kind of application will often show
various problems.

9.9 Clock Modes - Synchronization
In the digital world, all devices must be either Master (clock source) or Slave (clock receiver).
Whenever several devices are linked within a system, there must always be a single master
clock.
A digital system can only have one master! If the Babyface Pro’s clock mode is set to 'Inter-
nal', all other devices must be set to ‘Slave’.
The Babyface Pro utilizes a very user-friendly, intelligent clock control, called AutoSync. Select-
ing Optical as Clock Source, the system constantly scans the digital input for a valid signal. If
any valid signal is found, the Babyface Pro switches from the internal quartz (Clock Mode – Cur-
rent Internal) to a clock extracted from the input signal (Clock Mode – Current ADAT or SPDIF).
The difference to a usual slave mode is that whenever the clock reference fails, the system will
automatically use its internal clock and operate in clock mode Master.
AutoSync guarantees that record and record-while-play will always work correctly. In certain
cases however, e.g. when the inputs and outputs of a DAT machine are connected directly to
the Babyface Pro, AutoSync may cause feedback in the digital carrier, so synchronization breaks
down. To solve this problem switch the Babyface Pro clock mode to Master (Clock Source –
Internal).
In some situations changing the clock mode can not be avoided. Example: A CD player is con-
nected to the SPDIF input. Try recording a few samples from the CD and you will be disappoint-
ed - few CD players can be synchronized. The samples will inevitably be corrupted, because the
signal from the CD player is read with the clock from the Babyface Pro, being out of sync. In this
case, the Clock Source should be set temporarily to Optical In.
RME’s exclusive SyncCheck technology (first implemented in the Hammerfall) enables an easy
to use check and display of the current clock status. Input Status indicates whether there is a
valid signal (Lock, No Lock) for the optical input, or if there is a valid and synchronous signal
(Sync). In the field Clock Mode the clock reference is shown. See chapter 28.1.
Under WDM the Babyface Pro will
(has to) set the sample rate.
Therefore the error shown to the right
can occur. A stable signal with a
sample rate of 32 kHz is detected at
the ADAT input (Sync), but Windows
audio had been set to 44100 Hz
before. The red color of the text label
signals the error condition, and
prompts the user to set 32000 Hz
manually as sample rate. Under ASIO
the audio software sets the sample
rate, so that such an error can not
happen. If the input sample rate is
different then there will be no Sync indication.
With RME’s AutoSync and SyncCheck, finally anyone can master this common source of error,
previously one of the most complex issues in the digital studio world.

10. Operation under ASIO
10.1 General
Start the ASIO software and select ASIO Fireface USB as the audio I/O device or the audio
driver.
The Babyface Pro supports ASIO Direct Monitoring (ADM).
The Babyface Pro MIDI I/O can be used with both MME MIDI and DirectMusic MIDI.
10.2 Channel Count under ASIO
At a sample rate of 88.2 or 96 kHz, the ADAT optical input and output operates in S/MUX mode,
so the number of available channels is reduced from 8 to 4.
At a sample rate of 176.4 and 192 kHz, the ADAT optical input and output operates in S/MUX4
mode, so the number of available channels is limited to 2.
Note: When changing the sample rate range between Single, Double and Quad Speed the
number of channels presented from the ASIO driver will change too. This may require a reset of
the I/O list in the audio software.
Single Speed Double Speed Quad Speed
Babyface Pro Analog 1 to 4 Babyface Pro Analog 1 to 4 Babyface Pro Analog 1 to 4
Babyface Pro AS 1 to 2 Babyface Pro AS 1 to 2 Babyface Pro AS 1 to 2
Babyface Pro ADAT 3 to 4 Babyface Pro ADAT 3 to 4 Babyface Pro ADAT 3 to 4
Babyface Pro ADAT 5 to 6 Babyface Pro ADAT 5 to 6 Babyface Pro ADAT 5 to 6
Babyface Pro ADAT 7 to 8 Babyface Pro ADAT 7 to 8 Babyface Pro ADAT 7 to 8
User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME 25
10.3 Known Problems
If a computer does not provide sufficient CPU-power and/or sufficient USB-bus transfer rates,
then drop outs, crackling and noise will appear. Such effects can be avoided by using a higher
buffer setting/latency in the Settings dialog of the Babyface Pro. Furthermore PlugIns should be
deactivated temporarily to make sure they do not cause these problems.
More information can be found in chapter 28.3.
Another common source of trouble is incorrect synchronization. ASIO does not support asyn-
chronous operation, which means that the input and output signals not only have to use the
same sample frequency, but also have to be in sync. All devices connected to the Babyface Pro
must be properly configured for Full Duplex operation. As long as SyncCheck (in the Settings
dialog) only displays Lock instead of Sync, the devices have not been set up properly!
The same applies when using more than one Babyface Pro - they all have to be in sync. Else a
periodically repeated noise will be heard.
The Babyface Pro supports ASIO Direct Monitoring (ADM). Please note that not all programs
support ADM completely or error-free. The most often reported problem is the wrong behaviour
of panorama in a stereo channel. Also try to avoid setting the TotalMix FX hardware outputs
(third row) to mono mode. This will most likely break ADM compatibility.
In case of a drift between audio and MIDI, or in case of a fixed deviation (MIDI notes placed
close before or behind the correct position), the settings in Cubase/Nuendo have to be changed.
At the time of print the option 'Use System Timestamp' should be activated. The Babyface Pro
supports both MME MIDI and DirectMusic MIDI. It depends on the used application which one
will work better.
11. Using more than one Babyface Pro
The current driver supports up to three RME USB devices. All units have to be in sync, i.e. have
to receive valid digital sync information.
 If one of the units is set to clock mode Master, all others have to be set to clock mode Slave,
and have to be synced from the master by feeding ADAT or SPDIF. The clock modes of all
units have to be set up correctly in their Settings dialog.
 If all units are fed with a synchronous clock, i.e. all units show Sync in their Settings dialog,
all channels can be used at once. This is especially easy to use under ASIO, as the ASIO
driver presents all units as one.
Note: TotalMix FX is part of the hardware of each RME unit. Up to three mixers are available, but
these are separated and can't interchange data. Therefore a global mixer for all units is not pos-
sible.
In real-world an operation of more than one Babyface Pro seems not very useful. The second
unit must be synchronized using the optical input. The result is an extension by only 4 analog
record and 4 analog playback channels (plus 8 digital via ADAT Out). It makes much more sense
to directly connect an 8-channel converter to the ADAT I/O of one Babyface Pro, adding full 8
analog channels of record and playback.
On the other hand the second unit can even be used stand-alone, without any USB connection,
and might serve as an emergency replacement in case the main unit fails.

12. DIGICheck Windows
The DIGICheck software is a unique utility developed for testing, measuring and analysing digital
audio streams. Although this Windows software is fairly self-explanatory, it still includes a com-
prehensive online help. DIGICheck 5.92 operates as multi-client ASIO host, therefore can be
used in parallel to any software, with both inputs and outputs (!). The following is a short sum-
mary of the currently available functions:
 Level Meter. High precision 24-bit resolution, 2/8/12 channels. Application examples: Peak
level measurement, RMS level measurement, over-detection, phase correlation measure-
ment, dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratios, RMS to peak difference (loudness), long
term peak measurement, input check. Oversampling mode for levels higher than 0 dBFS.
Supports visualization according to the K-System.
 Hardware Level Meter for Input, Playback and Output. Reference Level Meter freely con-
figurable, causing near zero CPU load, because calculated from the Babyface Pro hardware.
 Spectral Analyser. World wide unique 10-, 20- or 30-band display in analog bandpass filter
technology. 192 kHz-capable!
 Vector Audio Scope. World wide unique Goniometer showing the typical afterglow of a os-
cilloscope-tube. Includes Correlation meter and level meter.
 Totalyser. Spectral Analyser, Level Meter and Vector Audio Scope in a single window.
 Surround Audio Scope. Professional Surround Level Meter with extended correlation analy-
sis, ITU weighting and ITU summing meter.
 ITU1770/EBU R128 Meter. For standardized loudness measurements.
 Bit Statistics & Noise. Shows the true resolution of audio signals as well as errors and DC
offset. Includes Signal to Noise measurement in dB and dBA, plus DC measurement.
 Channel Status Display. Detailed analysis and display of SPDIF and AES/EBU Channel
Status data.
 Global Record. Long-term recording of all channels at lowest system load.
 Completely multi-client. Open as many measurement windows as you like, on any chan-
nels and inputs or outputs!
DIGICheck is constantly updated. The latest version is always available on our website
www.rme-audio.com, section Downloads / DIGICheck. After download unzip the file and start
setup.exe to install DIGICheck.

13. Hotline – Troubleshooting
The input signal cannot be monitored in real-time
 ASIO Direct Monitoring has not been enabled within the DAW, and/or monitoring has been
disabled globally (TotalMix Options).
The 8 ADAT channels don’t seem to work
 The optical output has been switched to 'SPDIF' format. In TotalMix FX all channels and their
assignments still exist, but the optical transmitter is then limited to two channels. The ADAT
playback devices are still usable by routing and mixing them in TotalMix to other outputs.
Playback works, but record doesn’t
 Check that there is a valid signal at the input. If so, the current sample frequency is displayed
in the Settings dialog.
 Check whether the Babyface Pro has been selected as recording device in the audio applica-
tion.
 Check whether the sample frequency set in the audio application (‘Recording properties’ or
similar) matches the input signal.
 Check that cables/devices have not been connected in a closed loop. If so, set the system’s
clock mode to Master.
Crackle during record or playback
 Increase the number and size of buffers in the ‘Settings’ dialog or in the application.
 Try different cables (optical) to rule out any defects here.
 Check that cables/devices have not been connected in a closed loop. If so, set the system’s
clock mode to ‘Master’.
 Check the Settings dialog for displayed Errors.
Driver installation and Settings dialog/TotalMix work, but a playback or record is not possible
 While recognition and control of the device are low bandwidth applications, playback/record
needs the full USB transmission performance. Therefore, defective USB cables with limited
transmission bandwidth can cause such errors.

14. Hardware Installation
Connect computer and Babyface Pro with the supplied USB cable. Mac OS X detects the new
hardware as Babyface Pro (serial number).
In case the level meters of the Babyface Pro show CC during power-on, and Settings dialog and
TotalMix FX refuse to start: the unit is in Class Compliance mode. Remove the USB cable, hold
SELECT and DIM button down, plug-in the USB cable or the power supply. This procedure
changes between CC and normal mode. When the Level meters change to PC the normal mode
is active.
When using a power supply (stand-alone mode), holding down SELECT and DIM for more than
two seconds repeatedly changes between PC and CC. Note that changing the operating mode
is not supported during normal USB operation, so any USB connection has to be removed.
15. Driver and Firmware
15.1 Driver Installation
RME is constantly updating their drivers, and modern computers mostly do not have a CD drive
anymore. Therefore please download the drivers from the RME website at http://rme.to/usbe.
Unzip the downloaded file and start the driver installation by double-clicking Fireface USB.pkg.
During driver installation the programs Totalmix (TotalMix FX) and Fireface USB Settings are
copied to the Applications folder. They will automatically start into the dock if a Babyface Pro is
connected. A reboot of the computer is not required.
Driver Updates do not require to remove the existing drivers. Simply install the new driver over
the existing one.
Possible reasons why a Babyface Pro is not found after driver installation:
 The USB port is not active in the system (check in System Profiler, USB)
 The USB cable is not, or not correctly inserted into the socket
 The Babyface Pro does not receive any or not enough power. Remove current-consuming
hard drives from nearby ports. Avoid USB extension cables or USB hubs. Use an external
power supply, any standard one delivering 9 - 14 V DC with at least 1 A will work. The con-
nector needs to have – outside, + inside.
User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME 31
15.2 De-installing the Drivers
In case of problems the driver files can be deleted manually by dragging them to the trash bin:
/Applications/Fireface USB Settings
/Applications/Totalmix
/System/Library/Extensions/FirefaceUSB.kext
/Users/username/Library/Preferences/de.rme-audio.TotalmixFX.plist
/Users/username/Library/Preferences/de.rme-audio.Fireface_USB_Settings.plist
/Library/LaunchAgents/de.rme-audio.firefaceUSBAgent.plist
Under the latest Mac OS the User/Library folder is not visible in the Finder. To unhide it start
Finder, click on the menu item Go. Hold down the option (alt) key, then click on Library.
15.3 Firmware Update
The Flash Update Tool updates the firmware of the Babyface Pro to the latest version. It re-
quires an already installed driver. Please download the FUT from the RME website at
http://rme.to/usbe.
Unzip the downloaded file and start the firmware update with Fireface USB Flash. The Flash
Update Tool displays the current revision of the Babyface Pro firmware and whether it needs an
update or not. If so, simply press the 'Update' button. A progress bar will indicate when the flash
process is finished (Verify Ok).
After the update the unit needs to be reset. This is done by powering down the Babyface Pro for
5 seconds. A reboot of the computer is not necessary.
When the update fails (status: failure), the unit's second BIOS will be used from the next cold
boot on (Secure BIOS Technology). Therefore the unit stays fully functional. The flash process
should then be tried again on a different computer.

16. Configuring the Babyface Pro
16.1 Settings Dialog
Configuring the Babyface Pro is done via its own settings dialog. Start the program Fireface
USB Settings. The mixer of the Babyface Pro (TotalMix FX) can be configured by starting the
program Totalmix.
The Babyface Pro’s hardware offers a number of helpful, well thought-out practical functions and
options which affect how the card operates - it can be configured to suit many different require-
ments.
The following is available in the Settings dialog:
 Configuration of the digital I/O
 Current sample rate
 Synchronization behaviour
 State of input and output
Any changes performed in the Set-
tings dialog are applied immediately
- confirmation (e.g. by exiting the
dialog) is not required.
However, settings should not be
changed during playback or record
if it can be avoided, as this can
cause unwanted noises.
Use the drop down menu Proper-
ties For to select the unit to be con-
figured.
On the right of it the current firm-
ware and driver version is shown.
Options
DSP – EQ for Record
Switches the 3-band EQ and Low Cut of all input channels into the recording path. In case
Loopback has been activated the EQ and Low Cut of the Output channel is placed into the re-
cording path. See also chapter 23.6.
Optical Out
The optical TOSLINK output can operate as ADAT or SPDIF output. The Channel Status is fixed
to Consumer state.
Note: The optical input detects the incoming format automatically.

Clock Mode
Sample Rate
Used to set the current sample rate. This is the same setting as in the Audio MIDI Setup, just
added here for your convenience.
Clock Source
The unit can be configured to use its own clock (Internal = Master) or the digital input signal (Op-
tical = Slave). If the external source isn't available (Input Status No Lock), the unit will change to
the internal clock. The current clock source is displayed as Current.
Input Status
Indicates for the optical input whether there is a valid signal (Lock, No Lock), or if there is a valid
and synchronous signal (Sync). The third column shows the sample frequency detected by the
hardware (coarse recognition, 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz etc.). In Clock Mode the clock reference
is shown. See also chapter 28.1.
16.2 Clock Modes - Synchronization
In the digital world, all devices must be either Master (clock source) or Slave (clock receiver).
Whenever several devices are linked within a system, there must always be a single master
clock.
A digital system can only have one master! If the Babyface Pro’s clock mode is set to 'Inter-
nal', all other devices must be set to ‘Slave’.
The Babyface Pro utilizes a very user-friendly, intelligent clock control, called AutoSync. Select-
ing Optical as Clock Source, the system constantly scans the digital input for a valid signal. If
any valid signal is found, the Babyface Pro switches from the internal quartz (Clock Mode – Cur-
rent Internal) to a clock extracted from the input signal (Clock Mode – Current ADAT or SPDIF).
The difference to a usual slave mode is that whenever the clock reference fails, the system will
automatically use its internal clock and operate in clock mode Master.
AutoSync guarantees that record and record-while-play will always work correctly. In certain
cases however, e.g. when the inputs and outputs of a DAT machine are connected directly to
the Babyface Pro, AutoSync may cause feedback in the digital carrier, so synchronization breaks
down. To solve this problem switch the Babyface Pro clock mode to Master (Clock Source –
Internal).
In some situations changing the clock mode can not be avoided. Example: A CD player is con-
nected to the SPDIF input. Try recording a few samples from the CD and you will be disappoint-
ed - few CD players can be synchronized. The samples will inevitably be corrupted, because the
signal from the CD player is read with the clock from the Babyface Pro, being out of sync. In this
case, the Clock Source should be set temporarily to Optical.
RME’s exclusive SyncCheck technology (first implemented in the Hammerfall) enables an easy
to use check and display of the current clock status. Input Status indicates whether there is a
valid signal (Lock, No Lock) for the optical input, or if there is a valid and synchronous signal
(Sync). In the field Clock Mode the clock reference is shown. See chapter 28.1.
In practice, SyncCheck provides the user with an easy way of checking whether all digital devic-
es connected to the system are properly configured. With AutoSync and SyncCheck, finally any-
one can master this common source of error, previously one of the most complex issues in the
digital studio world.

17. Mac OS X FAQ
17.1 MIDI doesn't work
In some cases the applications do not show the MIDI port. The reason for this is usually visible
within the Audio MIDI Setup – MIDI Window. It displays no RME MIDI device, or the device is
greyed out and therefore inactive. In most cases removing the greyed out device and again
searching for MIDI devices will solve the problem.
The Babyface Pro is class compliant. Therefore it comes without a driver. OS X recognizes it as
MIDI device and will be using it with the driver included in the operating system.
17.2 Repairing Disk Permissions
Repairing permission can solve problems with the installation process - plus many others. To do
this, launch Disk Utility located in Utilities. Select your system drive in the drive/volume list to
the left. The First Aid tab to the right now allows you to check and repair disk permissions.
17.3 Supported Sample Rates
RME's Mac OS X driver supports all sampling frequencies provided by the hardware. This in-
cludes 176.4 kHz and 192 kHz.
But not any software will support all the hardware's sample rates. The hardware's capabilities
can easily be verified in the Audio MIDI Setup – Audio Window. Select the Babyface Pro. A
click on Format will list the supported sample rates.
17.4 Channel Count under Core Audio
At a sample rate of 88.2 or 96 kHz, the ADAT optical input and output operates in S/MUX mode,
so the number of available channels is reduced from 8 to 4.
At a sample rate of 176.4 and 192 kHz, the ADAT optical input and output operates in S/MUX4
mode, so the number of available channels is limited to 2.
It is not possible to change the number of Core Audio devices without a reboot of the computer.
Therefore whenever the Babyface Pro changes into Double Speed (88.2/96 kHz) or Quad
Speed mode (176.4/192 kHz) all devices stay present, but become partly inactive.
Single Speed Double Speed Quad Speed
Babyface Pro Analog 1 to 4 Babyface Pro Analog 1 to 4 Babyface Pro Analog 1 to 4
Babyface Pro AS 1 to 2 Babyface Pro AS 1 to 2 Babyface Pro AS 1 to 2
Babyface Pro ADAT 3 to 4 Babyface Pro ADAT 3 to 4 Babyface Pro ADAT 3 to 4
Babyface Pro ADAT 5 to 6 Babyface Pro ADAT 5 to 6 Babyface Pro ADAT 5 to 6
Babyface Pro ADAT 7 to 8 Babyface Pro ADAT 7 to 8 Babyface Pro ADAT 7 to 8
User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME 35
17.5 Various Information
The driver of the Babyface Pro requires at least Mac OS 10.6.
Programs that don't support card or channel selection will use the device chosen as Input and
Output in the System Preferences – Sound panel.
Via Launchpad – Other – Audio MIDI Setup the Babyface Pro can be configured for the sys-
tem wide usage in more detail.
Programs that don't support channel selection will always use channels 1/2, the first stereo pair.
To access other inputs, use the following workaround with TotalMix: route the desired input sig-
nal to output channels 1/2. In the channel settings of outputs 1/2 activate Loopback. Result: the
desired input signal is now available at input channel 1/2, without further delay/latency.
Use Configure Speakers to freely configure the stereo or multichannel playback to any availa-
ble channels.

18. Using more than one Babyface Pro
OS X supports the usage of more than one audio device within an audio software. This is done
via the Core Audio function Aggregate Devices, which allows to combine several devices into
one. All units have to be in sync, i.e. have to receive valid sync information via a digital input
signal.
 If one of the devices is set to clock mode Master, all others have to be set to clock mode
Slave, and have to be synced from the master by feeding ADAT or SPDIF. The clock modes
of all units have to be set up correctly in their Settings dialog.
 If all units are fed with a synchronous clock, i.e. all units show Sync in their Settings dialog,
all channels can be used at once.
Note: TotalMix is part of the hardware of each device. Up to three mixers are available, but
these are separated and can't interchange data. Therefore a global mixer for all units is not pos-
sible.
In real-world an operation of more than one Babyface Pro seems not very useful. The second
unit must be synchronized using the optical input. The result is an extension by only 4 analog
record and 4 analog playback channels (plus 8 digital via ADAT Out). It makes much more sense
to directly connect an 8-channel converter to the ADAT I/O of one Babyface Pro, adding full 8
analog channels of record and playback.
On the other hand the second unit can even be used stand-alone, without any USB connection,
and might serve as an emergency replacement in case the main unit fails.

20. Hotline – Troubleshooting
The unit and drivers have been installed correctly, but playback does not work:
 Is Babyface Pro listed in the System Profiler?
 Has Babyface Pro been selected as current playback device in the audio application?
The 8 ADAT channels don’t seem to work
 The optical output has been switched to 'SPDIF' format. In TotalMix FX all channels and their
assignments still exist, but the optical transmitter is then limited to two channels. The ADAT
playback devices are still usable by routing and mixing them in TotalMix to other outputs.
Playback works, but record doesn’t:
 Check that there is a valid signal at the input. If so, the current sample frequency is displayed
in the Settings dialog.
 Check whether the Babyface Pro has been selected as recording device in the audio applica-
tion.
 Check whether the sample frequency set in the audio application (‘Recording properties’ or
similar) matches the input signal.
 Check that cables/devices have not been connected in a closed loop. If so, set the system’s
clock mode to ‘Master’.
Crackle during record or playback:
 Increase the number and size of buffers in the application.
 Try different cables (coaxial or optical) to rule out any defects here.
 Check that cables/devices have not been connected in a closed loop. If so, set the system’s
clock mode to ‘Master’.
Driver installation and Settings dialog/TotalMix work, but a playback or record is not possible
 While recognition and control of the device are low bandwidth applications, playback/record
needs the full USB transmission performance. Therefore, defective USB cables with limited
transmission bandwidth can cause such an error scheme.

21. Routing and Monitoring
21.1 Overview
The Babyface Pro includes a powerful digital real-time mixer, based on RME’s unique, sample-
rate independent TotalMix technology. It allows for practically unlimited mixing and routing op-
erations, with all inputs and playback channels simultaneously, to any hardware outputs. To-
talMix FX adds 3-band parametric equalizer, low cut, echo and reverb.
Here are some typical applications for TotalMix:
 Setting up delay-free submixes (headphone mixes). The Babyface Pro allows for up to 6 fully
independent stereo submixes. On an analog mixing desk, this would equal 12 Aux sends.
 Unlimited routing of inputs and outputs (free utilisation, patchbay functionality).
 Distributing signals to several outputs simultaneously. TotalMix offers state-of-the-art splitter
and distributor functions.
 Simultaneous playback of different programs via a single stereo output. The ASIO multi-client
driver supports the usage of several programs at the same time. If this happens on different
playback channels TotalMix provides the means to mix and monitor these on a single stereo
output.
 Mixing of the input signal to the playback signal (complete ASIO Direct Monitoring). RME is
not only the pioneer of ADM, but also offers the most complete implementation of the ADM
functions.
 Integration of external devices. Use TotalMix to insert external effects devices, be it in the
playback or in the record path. Depending on the current application, the functionality equals
insert or effects send and effects return, for example as used during real-time monitoring
when adding some reverb to the vocals.
Every single input channel, playback channel and hardware output features a Peak and RMS
level meter, calculated in hardware. These level displays are very useful to determine the pres-
ence and routing destinations of the audio signals.
For a better understanding of the TotalMix mixer you should know the following:
 As shown in the block diagram (next page), the record signal usually stays un-altered. To-
talMix does not reside within the record path, and does not change the record level or the au-
dio data to be recorded (exceptions: EQ for Record and Loopback mode).
 The hardware input signal can be passed on as often as desired, even with different levels.
This is a big difference to conventional mixing desks, where the channel fader always con-
trols the level for all routing destinations simultaneously.
 The level meters of input and playback channels are connected pre-fader, to be able to visu-
ally monitor where a signal is currently present. The level meters of the hardware outputs are
connected post-fader, thus displaying the actual output level.

21.2 The User Interface
The visual design of the TotalMix mixer is a result of its capability to route hardware inputs and
software playback channels to any hardware output. The Babyface Pro has 12 input channels,
12 software playback channels, and 12 hardware output channels:
TotalMix can be used in the above view (View Options 2 Rows). However, the default is a verti-
cal alignment in three rows as known from an Inline desk, so that the row Software Playback
equals the Tape Return of a real mixing desk:
 Top row: Hardware inputs. The level shown is that of
the input signal, i.e. fader independent. Via fader and
routing menu, any input channel can be routed and
mixed to any hardware output (bottom row).
 Middle row: Playback channels (playback tracks of the
audio software). Via fader and routing menu, any play-
back channel can be routed and mixed to any hard-
ware output (bottom row).
 Bottom row: Hardware outputs. Here, the total level of
the output can be adjusted. This may be the level of
connected loudspeakers, or the level of any submix.
Usage in mode Submix View (Default)
Using TotalMix FX is really easy. Thanks to the Submix View (default) all you have to do is click
on the Hardware Output channel in the third row where the audio signal is supposed to show up.
This channel turns brighter, means it is selected as current submix. Now move the faders up
from all sources – these are the input and playback channels, in the first and second row. That’s
it. The input (monitoring) and playback (DAW software) audio signals are now available at that
very output, which can be verified immediately from the level meters reacting accordingly.
The following chapters explain step by step all functions of the user interface.
User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME 43
21.3 The Channels
A single channel can be switched between mono and stereo mode. The mode is set in the
channel settings.
Channel name. The name field is the preferred place to select a channel by a mouse click. A
double click opens a dialog to assign a different name. The original name will be shown when
activating the option Names in the View Options.
Panorama. Routes the input signal freely to the left and right routing destination
(lower label, see below). The level reduction in center position is -3 dB.
Mute and Solo. Input channels and playback channels each have a mute and solo
button.
Numerical level display. Shows the current RMS or Peak level, updated twice per
second. OVR means overload. The setting Peak/RMS is changed in the View Op-
tions.
Level meter. The meter shows both peak values (zero attack, 1 sample is enough
for a full scale display) by means of a yellow line, and mathematically correct RMS
values by means of a green bar. The RMS display has a relatively slow time con-
stant, so that it shows the average loudness quite well. Overs are shown in red at
the top of the bar. In the Preferences dialog (F2) the Peak Hold time, the over de-
tection and the RMS reference can be set.
Fader. Determines the gain/level of the signal routed to the current routing destination (lower
label). Please note that this fader is not the fader of the channel, but only the fader of the current
routing. Compared to a standard mixing desk TotalMix does not have a channel fader, but only
Aux Sends, as many as there are hardware outputs. Therefore TotalMix can create as many
different Submixes as there are hardware outputs. This concept is understood best in the Sub-
mix View, but more on that later.
Below the fader the Gain is shown in a numerical display
field, according to the current fader position. The fader
can be:
 dragged with the left mouse button pressed
 moved by the mouse wheel
 set to 0 dB and −∞ by a double click. The same
happens with a single click plus held down Ctrl key.
 adjusted in fine mode by mouse drag and mouse
wheel when holding the Shift key down
A Shift-click on a fader adds the fader to the temporary
fader group. All faders now marked yellow are ganged,
and move simultaneously in a relative way. The tempo-
rary fader group is deleted by a click on the F symbol in
the upper right of the window.
The arrow symbol at the bottom minimizes the channel width to that of the level meters. Anoth-
er click maximizes it again. A mouse click with held Ctrl key causes all channels to the right to
enlarge and minimize at once.
44 User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME
The lowest field shows the current routing target. A mouse click
opens the routing window to select a routing target. The list shows all
activated routings of the current channel by arrows in front of the listed
entries, the current one is shown in bold letters.
An arrow is only shown with an activated routing. A routing is seen as
activated when audio data is sent. As long as the fader is set to −∞ the
current routing will be shown in bold letters, but not have an arrow in
the front.
Trim Gain. After a click on the T-button one channel’s faders are all synchronized. Instead of
changing only a single routing the fader affects all the channel’s active routings. For a better
overview the faders currently not visible are indicated by orange triangles beside the fader path.
When moving the fader the triangles also move to a new position, equalling the faders new set-
tings.
Note that the fader button is set to the highest routing gain of all routings so that best control is
offered. The gain (fader knob position) of the currently active routing (the submix selected in the
third row) is shown as white triangle.
Background: TotalMix has no fixed channel fader. In case of the Babyface Pro
there are 6 stereo Aux sends, shown alternately as single fader within the channel
strip. The high number of Aux sends enables multiple and fully independent rout-
ings.
In some cases it is necessary to synchronize the gain changes of these routings.
An example is the Post fader function, where a change of the singer’s volume shall
be performed identical to the volume change of the signal sent to the reverb device,
so that the reverb level keeps its relation to the original signal. Another example is
the signal of a guitar that is routed to different submixes, means hardware outputs,
which gets much too loud during the solo part, and therefore needs to be reduced
in volume on all outputs simultaneously. After a click on the Trim button this can be
done easily and with a perfect overview.
As all channel’s routings change simultaneously when Trim is active, this mode
basically causes the same behaviour as a trim pot within the input channel, affect-
ing the signal already before the mixer. That’s how this function got its name.
In the View Options - Show the function Trim Gains can be globally switched on and off for all
channels. The global Trim mode is recommended when using TotalMix FX as live mixing desk.
The Context Menu. With a right click on the input, playback and output channels their context
menus provide advanced functionality (these menus are also available in the Matrix, but only
directly on the channel labels). The entries are self-explanatory and automatically adjust to
where the click is performed. The input channels offer Clear, Copy input, paste the input mix and
paste its FX. On a playback channel Copy, Paste and Clear the playback mix are available. On
an output channel Copy and Mirror functionality for the current submix and copying of the FX
settings is offered.
User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME 45
A click on the tool symbol opens the channel’s Settings panel with differing elements. For ex-
ample the Option PAD exists only in input channel 1/2, and the ADAT channels do not offer the
phantom power option.
Stereo. Switches the channel to mono or stereo mode.
48V. Activates phantom power at the corresponding input. Serves as
power supply for high quality condenser mics. This option should stay off
with other sources to prevent failure by spikes.
PAD. Applies -11 dB damping for the XLR input signal. Also increases
the input impedance.
Gain. Sets the gain for both analog inputs. The knob can be adjusted by
dragging the mouse or by the mouse wheel. This also works when the
mouse has been moved over the two gain displays. Then the gain can
be changed separately for left and right channel, even when the channel
is in stereo mode.
Width. Setting the stereo width. 1.00 equals full stereo, 0.00 mono, -1.00
swapped channels.
FX Send. Setting the level of the signal sent to the FX bus which feeds Echo and Reverb. The
current setting is also visible with closed channel settings, because knob and small fader are
always synchronized. To make this function as useful as possible FX Send is locked to the high-
est submix, thus imitating the Aux Post Fader function of a standard mixing desk. When moving
the big fader both knob and small fader will also move. This way the reverb signal will always
have the same relation to the dry signal.
The level of the signal sent to the effects can be controlled by the FX In level meters of the FX
window. It becomes visible after a click on FX in the View Options.
MS Proc. Activates M/S processing within the stereo channel. Monaural information is sent to
the left channel, stereo information to the right.
Phase L. Inverts the phase of the left channel by 180°.
Phase R. Inverts the phase of the right channel by 180°.
Note: the functions Width, MS Proc, Phase L and Phase R affect all routings of the respective
channel.
Besides Stereo/Mono, Phase L und Phase R the settings of the Hard-
ware Outputs have further options:
FX Return. The effect signal (Echo and Reverb) is mixed to the respec-
tive hardware output by the duo knob/small fader.
Talkback. Activates this channel as receiver and output of the Talkback
signal. This way Talkback can be sent to any outputs, not only the
Phones in the Control Room section. Another application could be to
send a certain signal to specific outputs by the push of a button.
No Trim. Sometimes channels need to have a fixed routing and level,
which should not be changed in any case. An example is the stereo mix-
down for recording of a live show. With No Trim active, the routing to this
output channel is excluded from the Trim Gains function, therefore is not
changed unintentionally.
Loopback. Sends the output data to the driver as record data. The corresponding submix can
46 User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME
be recorded then. This channel’s hardware input sends its data only to TotalMix, no longer to the
recording software.
Another difference to the input and playback channels is the Cue button instead of Solo. A click
on Cue sends the respective Hardware Output’s audio to the Main Out, or any of the Phones
outputs (option Assign / Cue to in the Control Room section). With this any hardware output can
be controlled and listened to through the monitoring output very conveniently.
A click on EQ opens the Equalizer panel. It is available in all input and output channels, and
affects all routings of the respective channel (pre fader). The panel includes a low cut and a 3-
band parametric equalizer which can be activated separately.
EQ. Activated by the EQ button.
Type. Band 1 and 3 can operate in peak (bell) or shelf
(shelving) mode. The middle band is fixed to peak mode.
Gain. All three bands can change their amplitude (amplifi-
cation) between +20 dB to -20 dB.
Freq. The center frequency of the filter is adjustable be-
tween 20 Hz and 20 kHz. While in peak mode the center
frequency is adjusted, in shelf mode the cut-off point (-3
dB) will be changed.
Q. The Quality factor of the filter is adjustable from 0.7
(wide) to 5.0 (narrow).
Lo Cut. Activated by the button Lo Cut. The slope of the
high-pass filter is adjustable between 6, 12, 18 and 24 dB
per octave. The cut-off point (-3 dB) is adjustable between
20 Hz and 500 Hz.
The frequency graphics give a precise overview of the filter results. Overlapping filters influence
each other. This can be used to achieve more than 20 dB amplitude, or to generate difficult fre-
quency response optimizations.
Note: TotalMix has an internal headroom of 24 dB. Extreme boosts with overlapping filters can
therefore cause an internal overload. In any case such an overload is displayed by the Over LED
of the channel’s level meter.
User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME 47
Preset. Settings of the EQ and the Low Cut
can be stored, loaded, and copied between
channels at any time. A click on Preset opens
a menu with several entries:
 Recall: Presets stored before by the user
can be selected and loaded
 Save to: There are 16 storage places
available (EQ Preset 1 to 16)
 Import: Loads a previously stored TM EQ
file (.tmeq)
 Export: Stores the current state as TM
EQ file (.tmeq)
 Factory: Includes 14 examples for the
creative use of Low Cut and Equalizer
 Reset: Resets the Low Cut and EQ to
have zero influence (Gain 0 dB)
 Rename: The EQ Presets 1 to 16 can be renamed. The changes will be shown in both lists
Recall and Save to.
Notes on the EQ Presets
Copy between channels: The EQ Preset menu of all channels is identical. If an EQ setup is
stored via Save to on one of the 16 storage places, it is then also available in any other channel
via Recall.
Copy between Snapshots: The Presets are not saved in Snapshots, therefore do not change
when a different Snapshot is loaded. Presets are saved in Workspaces and also loaded with
these.
Copy between Workspaces: is done by the export and import function of the Preset menu.
Important and useful Presets should always be saved as TM EQ file, so that they can not get
lost even on accidental overwrite.
Factory Presets: loads like all Presets the settings of both Low Cut and EQ simultaneously. The
current state, On or Off, is neither saved nor activated on load. With this a preset can be loaded
anytime, but will not become active before the user decides to switch the EQ and/or LC on –
except they had been active already before the load process. For this reason some Factory Pre-
sets have special names. For example Telephone (LC+EQ) will sound much better when the LC
has been activated additionally to the EQ, as the LC is set to an unusual high frequency of 500
Hz here.

21.4 Section Control Room
In the section Control Room the menu Assign is used to define the Main Out which is used for
listening in the studio. For this output the functions Dim, Recall, Mono, Talkback, External Input
and Mute FX are automatically applied. On the unit the button DIM also follows this assignment.
Additionally the channel will be shifted from the Hardware
Outputs into the Control Room section, and renamed Main.
The same happens when assigning Main Out B or the
Phones. The original name can be displayed by the function
Names in the View Options - Show at any time.
Phones 1 and 2 will have dim (set in Settings) and a special
routing applied when Talkback is activated. Also putting them
beside the Main Out increases the overview within the output
section greatly.
Dim. The volume will be reduced by the amount set in the
Settings dialog (F3).
Recall. Sets the gain value defined in the Settings dialog. Can
also be set at the unit in Output mode by holding down the
SET button for two seconds.
Speaker B. Switches audio from Main Out to Main Out B. The faders of the channels Main and
Speaker B can be ganged via Link. Via Options / Key Commands switching to Speaker B can
also be controlled by the unit’s OUT, A, B and DIM button.
Mono. Mixes left and right channel. Useful to check for mono compatibility and phase problems.
Talkback. A click on this button will dim all signals on the Phones outputs by an amount set up
in the Preferences dialog. At the same time the control room's microphone signal (source de-
fined in Preferences) is sent to the Phones. The microphone level is adjusted with the channel's
input fader.
External Input. Switches Main monitoring from the mix bus to the stereo input defined in the
Settings dialog (F3). The relative volume of the stereo signal is adjusted there as well.
Mute FX. Mutes Reverb and Echo on the Main Out, to hear the mix without those effects.
Assign. Allows to define the Main Out, Main
Out B, and up to two Phones outs.
The output for the Cue signal, which is usu-
ally Main, can also be set to one of the
Phones outputs. This setting also controls
the PFL monitoring.

21.5 The Control Strip
The Control Strip on the right side is a fixed element. It combines different functions that are
either required globally, or constantly used, and therefore should not be hidden in a menu. It can
still be hidden via the top menu Window – Hide Control Strip.
The areas described in the following chapters can be minimized by a click on the arrow in their
title bar.
Device selection. Select the unit to be controlled in case more than one is
installed on the computer.
FX - DSP Meter. Shows the DSP load caused by activated EQs and Low
Cuts. The DSP of the Babyface Pro has been designed so that an overload
cannot occur. The display therefore is for information purposes only.
Undo / Redo. With the unlimited Undo and Redo changes of the mix can be
undone and redone, at any time. Undo/Redo does not cover graphical chang-
es (window size, position, channels wide/narrow etc.), and also no changes to
the Presets. The accidental overwrite of an EQ Preset can not be made un-
done.
Undo/Redo also operates across Workspaces. Therefore a completely differ-
ently set up mixer view can be loaded via Workspace, and with a single click
on Undo the previous internal mixer state is returned – but the new mixer view
stays.
Global Mute Solo Fader.
Mute. Global Mute operates in a pre fader style, muting all currently activated routings of the
channel. As soon as any Mute button is pressed, the Mute Master button lights up in the Control
Strip area. With this button all selected mutes can be switched off and on again. One can com-
fortably set up a mute group or activate and deactivate several mute buttons simultaneously.
Solo. As soon as any Solo button is pressed, the Solo Master button lights up in the Control
Strip area. With this button all selected Solos are switched off and on again. Solo operates as
Solo-in-Place, post fader style, as known from common mixing desks. A typical limitation for
mixing desks, Solo working only globally and only for the Main Out, does not exist in TotalMix.
Solo is always activated for the current submix only.
Fader. A Shift-click on a fader adds the fader to the temporary fader group. All faders now
marked yellow are ganged, and move simultaneously in a relative way. The temporary fader
group is deleted by a click on the F symbol.

21.5.1 View Options
The field View Options combines different functions of routing, the level meters and the mixer
view.
Routing Mode
 Submix: The Submix view (default) is the preferred view and delivers the
quickest overview, operation and understanding of TotalMix. The click on
one of the Hardware Output channels selects the respective submix, all
other outputs are darkened. At the same time all routing fields are set to
this channel. With Submix view, it is very easy to generate a submix for
any output: select the output channel, adjust the fader and pans of first
and second row – finished.
 Free: The Free view is for advanced users. It is used to edit several sub-
mixes simultaneously, without the need to change between them. Here
one works with the routings fields of the input and playback channels only,
which then show different routing destinations.
Level Meters
 Post FX. Switches all level meters before (pre) or after (post) the effects. Level changes by
these can be easily checked using this feature. Additionally the input signal can be checked
for overloads. It is recommended to use Post FX as default setting, as the extreme reduction
of a signal by LC/EQ is very seldom. Also all the Over displays of all level meters operate
both pre and post, efficiently preventing overloads going unnoticed.
 RMS. The numerical level display in the channels displays peak or RMS.
Show
 FX. Opens the window to set up the effects Reverb and Echo.
 Trim. Activates all Trim buttons on all channels. TotalMix thus behaves like a conventional,
simple mixing desk. Each fader affects all active routings of the channel simultaneously, as
if the fader were a trim-pot in the hardware input.
 2 Row. Switches the mixer view to 2 rows. Hardware Inputs and Software Playbacks are
placed side by side. This view saves a lot of space, especially in height.
 Names. Display of the original names of channels when they had been renamed by the us-
er.

21.5.2 Snapshots - Groups
Snapshots. Snapshots include all mixer settings, but no graphical elements like window posi-
tions, window size, number of windows, visible EQs or Settings, scroll states, Presets etc. Only
the state wide/narrow of the channels is registered. Moreover the Snapshot is only temporarily
stored. Loading a Workspace causes the loss of all stored Snapshots, when these all had not
been saved before in a Workspace, or separately via File / Save Snapshot as. Via File / Load
Snapshot the mixer states can be loaded individually.
8 different mixes can be stored under individual names in the Snapshot sec-
tion. A click on any of the 8 buttons loads the corresponding Snapshot. A dou-
ble click on the name field opens the dialog Input Name to edit the name. As
soon as the mixer state is changed the button starts flashing. A click on Store
lets all buttons flash, whereby the last loaded one, the base of the current
state, flashes inversely. The storage finishes by clicking the desired button
(means storage place). The storage process is exited by another click on the
flashing Store button.
The area Snapshots can be minimized by a click on the arrow in the title bar.
Groups. The area Groups provides 4 storage places each for fader, mute and
solo groups. The groups are valid per Workspace, being active and usable in
all 8 Snapshots. But with this they are also lost when loading a new work-
space, in case they have not been saved before in a different Workspace.
Note: The Undo function will help in case of an accidental overwrite or deletion
of the groups.
TotalMix uses flashing signals to guide you through the group setup. After a click on Edit and
click on the desired storage place all desired functions for this group have to be activated or
selected. The storage process is finished by another click on Edit.
When setting up a fader group make sure to not add faders that are at the most top or lowest
position, except all faders of that group have this position.
The Mute groups operate – other than the global mute – exclusively for the current routing. This
way you can not mute signals on all outputs unintentionally. Instead signals can be muted on
specific submixes by the push of a button.
A solo group operates exactly like the global solo, signals outside the current routing are not
affected.

21.5.3 Channel Layout - Layout Presets
To maintain overview within TotalMix FX channels can be hidden. Channels can also be exclud-
ed from being remoted. Under Options / Channel Layout a dialog lists all I/Os with their current
state. Selecting one or several channels enables the options to the right:
 Hide Channel in Mixer/Matrix. The selected channels are no longer shown in TotalMix FX,
nor are they available via MIDI or OSC remote control.
 Hide Channel in MIDI Remote 1-4. The selected channels are hidden for MIDI remote (CC
and Mackie Protocol).
 Hide Channel in OSC Remote 1-4. The selected channels are hidden for OSC remote
control.
Hidden channels in Mixer/Matrix are still fully functional. An existing routing/mixing/FX pro-
cessing stays active. But as the channel is no longer visible it can not be edited anymore. At the
same time the hidden channels are removed from the list of remote controllable channels, to
prevent them from being edited unnoticed.
Hidden channels in MIDI Remote x are removed from the list of remote controllable channels.
Within an 8-channel block of a Mackie compatible control they are skipped. The control there-
fore is no longer bound to consecutive orders. For example it will control channels 1, 2, and 5 to
10, when channels 3 and 4 are hidden.
The same can be done for OSC. With unnecessary channels made invisible for the OSC remote
the more important channels are available as one block on the remote.
The dialog can be called directly from TotalMix by a right mouse click on any channel. The cor-
responding channel will then be preselected in the dialog.
In the above example ADAT channels have been made invisible. When ADAT is not used this is
an easy way to remove them from the mixer completely.
Pages Inputs, Playbacks and Outputs are set up individually by the tabs at the top. A double
click onto any line opens the edit field for the Name (User) column. Editing channel names in
this dialog is quick, Enter jumps to the next line. The names of the channels in the Control Room
section can only be changed this way.
User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME 53
!
After finishing those settings the whole state can be stored as Layout Preset.
A click on Store and the desired memory slot makes the current channel layout
recallable anytime. The button All makes all channels temporarily visible again.
With a simple click on a button it will then be possible to easily switch views of
only the channels involved with the mixing of the drum section, the horn sec-
tion, the violins, or any other useful view. An optimized remote layout can be
activated here as well, with or without visible changes. Double-click the default
slot name to enter any other name.
Layout Presets are stored within the Workspace, so make sure to save the current state
before loading a different Workspace!
The button Sub activates another useful special view. When in Submix view, Sub will cause all
channels to disappear that are not part of the currently selected Submix/Hardware Output. Sub
temporarily shows the mix based on all channels from Inputs and Playback row, independent
from the current Layout Preset. That makes it very easy to see and to verify which channels are
mixed/routed to the current output. Sub makes checking and verifying of mixes, but also the mix
editing itself, a lot easier, and maintains perfect overview even with lots of channels.
21.5.4 Scroll Location Markers
Another feature to improve overview and working with TotalMix FX are scroll location markers
(TotalMix view only). These are displayed automatically when the horizontal size of the TotalMix
FX window is smaller than the channel display requires. Shown on the right side of the scrollbar
of each row they have four elements:
 Arrow to the left. A left mouse click
let the channels scroll to the very
first one, or most left.
 1. Marker number 1. Scroll to the
desired position and perform a right
mouse click on 1. A dialog comes
up with precise information. Once
stored, a left mouse click will scroll
the channels to the stored position.
 2. Marker number 2. See 1 for de-
tails.
 Arrow to the right. A left mouse
click let the channels scroll the last
one, or most right.
Scroll Location markers are stored in
the Workspace.
Application Examples
While originally added to improve navigation in the HDSPe MADI FX (having 196 channels that
never fit on any screen), the scroll location markers are also helpful with units having much less
channels:
 When the TotalMix FX window is intentionally made small in width, so only a few channels
are shown.
 When some or all EQ or Dynamics panels are open. Then all relevant settings are always
visible, but require a lot of space horizontally.

21.6 Reverb and Echo
A click on FX in the View Options - Show brings up the Output FX panel. Here all parameters for
the effects Reverb and Echo are adjusted.
The Babyface Pro uses a DSP engine within its FPGA for all the calculations of all the EQs and
Low Cuts, in parallel to the TotalMix DSP mixing engine. However, Reverb and Echo are calcu-
lated on the host CPU - the computer. On current computers, this will not cause any noticeable
CPU load.
The transmission of the stereo signal FX Send to the computer and the effects signal FX Out
back to the Babyface Pro is done by two invisible ASIO channels. The delay (latency) generated
by this method is of no consequence for the offered effects reverb and echo. But it is still taken
into account for the adjustment of the Reverb PreDelay. The lowest value depends on the cur-
rently chosen buffer size (see Settings dialog, chapter 8.1).
Reverb. Activated by the On button.
Type. Lists different reverb types for selection. Available are:
 Rooms Small, Medium, Large, Walls. Room simulation of rooms
in different size and behaviour.
 Shorty provides a short, rich and warm reverb.
 Attack slaps back.
 Swagger enriches and blows up the original sound source.
 Old School is just that.
 Echoistic has a heavy echo part within the reverb sound which
brings some nice stereo effect as well.
 8plus9 is a mixture of Old School and Echoistic.
 Grand Wide stands for a wide and open room and space.
 Thicker can be used as short reverb to enrich the original signal.
 Space has the most sizzle and longest reverb time.
 Envelope. Reverb effect where the volume course (envelope) is
freely adjustable.
 Gated. Simpler version of the Envelope reverb for cut reverb ef-
fects.
Please note that all these reverb types are extremely flexible due to the
available Smooth and Room Scale controls. Most of them can be used
as short and long reverb, and sound totally different with Smooth turned
to maximum or minimum.
TotalMix FX comes with factory presets and default values for all reverb types to ensure a fast
setup time and quick results. Please take the time to experiment with them with different signals
and different settings, to learn how different they can sound and can be used.
User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME 55
General Settings
PreDelay. Delay of the reverb signal. Adjustable from 0 ms up to 999 ms.
Low Cut. High-pass filter before the reverb generation, removes low frequency signals which
should not cause a reverb sound. Adjustable from 20 Hz up to 500 Hz.
High Cut. Low-pass filter after the reverb generation. A reduction of the treble often lets the
reverb sound more natural. Adjustable from 5 kHz up to 20 kHz.
Smooth. Softens the reverb effect, affects stereo width, density and sound colour. Adjustable
from 0 up to 100.
Width. Adjusts the stereo width of the reverb signal from 100 (stereo) to 0 (mono).
Volume. Adjusts the level of the reverb effects signal sent to the FX return bus.
Special Settings for Room Types
Room Scale. Determines the size of the room, thus changing density and length of the reverb
effect. Adjustable from 0.5 up to 3.0.
Special Settings for Envelope and Gated
Attack. Length of time for the volume increase of the reverb signal. Also called rise time. Ad-
justable from 5 ms up to 400 ms.
Hold. Length of time for the fixed volume part of the reverb signal. Adjustable from 5 ms up to
400 ms.
Release. Length of time for the volume decrease of the reverb signal. Adjustable from 5 ms up
to 400 ms.
Special Settings for Space
Reverb Time. Sets the duration of the reverb referenced to a volume drop of 20 dB. Adjustable
from 0.1 s up to 4.9 s.
High Damp. Sets the treble damping over time for the reverb signal. In principle, this is a low-
pass filter like High Cut. Because of the operation principle of this reverb it shows a slightly dif-
ferent behaviour. Adjustable from 5 kHz up to 20 kHz.
56 User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME
Echo. Activated by the On button.
Type. Lists different echo algorithms for selection. Available are:
 Stereo Echo. Separated echo generators on left and right channel. As a result the echo
follows the sound source within the stereo field.
 Stereo Cross. Echo generator on left and right channel with cross coupled feedback which
is only working for the stereo parts of the input signal. In case the input signal is only left or
right the Stereo Cross acts exactly like the Pong Echo.
 Pong Echo. Generates an echo that jumps between left and right channel, independent
from the source signal’s stereo position.
Settings
Delay Time. Sets the delay time for the first echo.
BPM. A double click on the lower value field offers a delay adjustment as Beats Per Minute.
Feedback. Feedback to produce further echoes.
Width. Adjusts the stereo width of the echo signal from 100 (stereo) to 0 (mono).
Volume. Adjusts the level of the echo effects signal sent to the FX return bus.
High Cut (HC). Option for more natural sound or intentional damping of the delayed signal.
Preset. Settings of the Reverb and the Echo can be stored, loaded, and copied between chan-
nels at any time. A click on Preset opens a menu with several entries:
 Recall: Presets stored before by the user
can be selected and loaded
 Save to: There are 16 storage places avail-
able (Reverb/Echo Preset 1 to 16)
 Import: Loads a previously stored TM FX
Reverb file (.tmrv) or a TM FX Echo file
(.tmeo)
 Export: Stores the current state as TM FX
Reverb file (.tmrv) or as TM FX Echo file
(.tmeo)
 Factory: Includes 10 examples for the con-
figuration of the Reverb
 Reset: Resets the Reverb or Echo
 Rename: The Presets 1 to 16 can be renamed. The changes will be shown in both lists
Recall and Save to.

21.7 Preferences
The dialog Preferences can be opened via the Options menu or directly via F2.
Level Meters
 Full scale samples for OVR. Number
of consecutive samples to trigger an
over detection (1 to 10).
 Peak Hold Time. Hold time of the
peak value. Adjustable from 0.1 up to
9.9 s.
 RMS +3 dB. Shifts the RMS value by
+3 dB, so that full scale level is identi-
cal for Peak and RMS at 0 dBFS.
Mixer Views
 FX Send follows highest Submix.
Locks the FX Send knob to the chan-
nel fader. As TotalMix supports multi-
ple routings per channel, a definition is
needed which fader (only one is visi-
ble) is the one that FX Send will follow.
This is always the one with the highest
fader position, means the highest gain.
 FX Send follows Main Out. Locks
the FX Send knob to the channel fader
only for the Main Out submix. This is a
typical Live feature, where the FX
Send is always tied to the fader for the
most important output - the Main Out.
When adjusting other submixes the
FX send will not follow the fader
movement.
 Center Balance/Pan when changing
Mono/Stereo. When switching a ste-
reo channel into two mono channels
the pan-pots are set fully left and right.
This option will set them to center in-
stead.
 Disable double click fader action.
Prevents unintentional gain settings,
for example when using sensitive
touchpads.
Dynamic Meters
Not valid for the Babyface Pro.
Snapshots
 Do not load Main volume/balance. The values stored in the Snapshot are not loaded for
the Main Out and all groups of output faders joined by Main, so the current setting for all
these is not changed.
Device Handling
Always init… and Count MADI… are not valid for the Babyface Pro.
 Disable ASIO Direct Monitoring. Disables ASIO Direct Monitoring (ADM) for the Babyface
Pro within TotalMix FX.
58 User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME
Graphics
 Use D2D (Change requires restart). Default on. Can be deactivated to use a compatible
but CPU-taxing graphics mode, in case graphics problems show up.
 Brightness correction. Set TotalMix FX screen brightness to your taste, matching the mon-
itor setting or the environment.
Store Setting for (Windows only)
 All Users (Restart required). See next chapter.
Special Options
 Lock User Interface. Default off. Can be activated to freeze the current mix state. Faders,
buttons and knobs relating to the mix state cannot be moved anymore.
21.7.1 Store for Current or All Users (Windows)
TotalMix FX stores all settings, workspaces and snapshots for the current user in:
XP: C:\Documents and Settings\ Username\Local Settings\ Application Data\TotalMixFX
Since Vista: C.\Users\Username\AppData\Local\TotalMixFX
Current User ensures that when workstations are used by several people they all find their own
settings. In case the settings should be identical or given for any user, TotalMix FX can be
changed to use the All User directory. An admin could even write protect the file lastBabyface
Pro1.xml, which results in a complete reset to that file’s content whenever TotalMix FX is re-
started. The xml-file is updated on exit, so simply set up TotalMix as desired and exit it (right
mouse click on the symbol in the notification area).

21.8 Settings
The dialog Settings can be opened via the Options menu or directly via F3.
21.8.1 Mixer Page
On the mixer page some typical settings for the mixer operation are set, like Talkback source,
Dim amount when Talkback is active, the stored main volume or the input used for the External
Input function.
Talkback
 Input. Selects the input channel of the
Talkback signal (microphone in control
room). Default: None.
 Dim. Amount of attenuation of the sig-
nals routed to the Phones in dB.
Listenback
 Input. Selects the input channel of the
Listenback signal (microphone in re-
cording room). Default: None.
 Dim. Amount of attenuation of the sig-
nals routed to the Main Out in dB.
Main Out
 Recall. User defined listening volume,
activated by the Recall button at the
unit or in TotalMix.
 Dim. Amount of attenuation for the
Main Out in dB.
 External Input. Selects the stereo
input that replaces the mix signal on
the Main Out when activated. The vol-
ume of the stereo signal is adjusted by
the slider Gain.
PFL Mode
 Live Mode, PFL replaces Solo. PFL means Pre Fader Listening. This feature is very useful
when operating TotalMix in a live environment, as it allows to quickly listen/monitor any of
the inputs by hitting the Solo button. The monitoring happens on the output set for the
Cue/PFL to output in the Assign dialog.

21.8.2 MIDI Page
The MIDI page has four independent settings for up to four MIDI remote controls, using CC
commands or the Mackie Control protocol.
Index
Select one of four settings pages and thus remote controls. Settings are remembered automati-
cally. To activate or deactivate any of the four remote controls check or uncheck ‘In Use’.
MIDI Remote Control
 MIDI In. Input where TotalMix receives MIDI Remote data.
 MIDI Out. Output where TotalMix sends MIDI Remote data.
 Disable MIDI in background. Deactivates MIDI Remote Control as soon as another appli-
cation is in the focus, or when TotalMix has been minimized.
Mackie Control Options
 Enable Protocol Support. When
disabled TM FX will only react on the
Control Change commands of chapter
24.5.
 Extender to. Sets the current remote
to be an extender to the main remote.
Both remotes will be shown as one
block and navigate simultaneously.
 Map Stereo to 2 Mono Channels.
One fader controls one (mono) chan-
nel. Should be disabled when stereo
channels are used.
 Submix Selection in Input/Playback
Row. Enables a selection of the sub-
mix when in first row, without having to
change to the third row first. However,
when using both mono and stereo
channels first and third row usually do
not match anymore, so the selection
often becomes unclear this way.
 Enable full LCD support. Activates
full Mackie Control LCD support with
eight channel names and eight vol-
ume/pan values.
 Send User defined Names. Channel
names defined by the user will be sent
to the remote device via MIDI and – if
supported – shown in its display.
 Send Level Messages. Activates the
transmission of the level meter data. Peak Hold activates the peak hold function as set up
for the TotalMix level meters in the preferences.
Note: When MIDI Out is set to NONE then TotalMix FX can still be controlled by Mackie Control
MIDI commands, but the 8-channel block is not marked as remote target.
User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME 61
21.8.3 OSC Page
The OSC page has four independent settings for up to four MIDI remote controls via Open
Sound Control (OSC). This is a network based remote protocol that can be used for example by
Apple’s iPad with the app TouchOSC or Lemur to wirelessly remote control TotalMix FX running
on a Mac or Windows computer.
Index
Select one of four settings pages and thus remote controls. Settings are remembered automati-
cally. To activate or deactivate any of the four remote controls check or uncheck ‘In Use’.
TotalMix FX OSC Service
 IP. Shows the network address of the
computer running TotalMix FX (local
host). This address must be entered on
the remote side.
 Host Name. Local computer name.
 Port incoming. Must match the remote
entry ‘Port outgoing’. Typical values are
7001 or 8000.
 Port outgoing. Must match the remote
entry ‘Port incoming’. Typical values are
9001 or 9000.
Remote Control
 IP or Host name. Enter the IP or host
name of the remote control. Please
note that the IP number usually works
better than the host name.
Options
 Send Peak Level. Activates the trans-
mission of the peak level meter data.
Peak Hold activates the peak hold func-
tion as set up for the TotalMix level me-
ters in the preferences.
 Lock Remote to submix. When acti-
vated the current remote control can
only modify the submix selected from
the drop-down list. This prevents havoc
in multi-remote monitoring environ-
ments.
 Number of faders per bank. Available choices are 8 (default), 12, 16, and 24. Note that
when working in underperforming networks, especially wireless, a higher number of faders
might not work as smooth as expected.

21.8.4 Aux Devices
The RME OctaMic XTC is a highly flexible
hi-quality 8-channel microphone, line and
instrument preamp with integrated AD-
conversion to ADAT, AES/EBU and MADI,
plus 4 channels of DA-conversion for moni-
toring. It can be used as universal front-
end for the Babyface Pro and other inter-
faces.
To simplify operation the most important
parameters of the XTC (gain, 48V,
Inst/PAD, AutoSet) can be controlled di-
rectly from the TotalMix FX input channels.
This special remote control uses MIDI of
any format (DIN, USB, MIDI over MADI).
Device Settings
 Digital Channels. Select where the
OctaMic XTC sends its 8 analog chan-
nels to. With the Babyface Pro this will
be the ADAT channels 1-8.
 Device. At this time only the OctaMic
XTC is supported and can be chosen.
MIDI Settings
 MIDI In. Set the currently used MIDI connection to OctaMic XTC.
 MIDI Out. Set the currently used MIDI connection to OctaMic XTC.
 Device ID. Default 0. This setting relates to the current choice in Digital Channels.
The screenshot to the right shows what happens as
soon as the above settings have been confirmed
with OK. The ADAT channels show new elements
for phantom power, Inst/PAD, Gain and AutoSet.
Control operates bidirectional, so changing the gain
at the unit will be mirrored in the TotalMix channels.
Changing the gain in TotalMix FX will set the gain in
the unit, which is also shown on the unit’s display.
For the remote to work the XTC’s currently used
MIDI I/Os have to be set to Control. More details are
found in the manual of the OctaMic XTC.

21.9 Hotkeys and Usage
TotalMix FX has many hotkeys and mouse/hotkey combinations to speed up and simplify the
usage. The below description refers to Windows. On Mac substitute Ctrl in the below list with the
command key ().
The Shift key enables a fine-tuning of the gain with all faders and in the Matrix. On all knobs it
will speed up the setting.
A click on a fader with held down Shift key adds the fader to the temporary fader group.
A click in the fader path with held down Ctrl key will let the fader jump to 0 dB, at the next click
to −∞
. Same function: Double click of the mouse.
Clicking on one of the Panorama or Gain knobs with held down Ctrl key lets the knob jump to
center position. Same function: Double click of the mouse.
Clicking on the Panorama knob with held down Shift key lets the knob jump to fully left, with
Shift-Ctrl to fully right.
Clicking on one of the channel settings buttons (slim/normal, settings, EQ) with held down Ctrl
key lets all channels to the right change their state. For example all panels can be
opened/closed simultaneously.
A double click of the mouse on a knob or its numerical field opens the according Input Value
dialog. The desired value can then be set by keyboard.
Dragging the mouse from a parameter field increases (move up) or decreases (move down) the
value in the field.
Ctrl-N opens the dialog Function Select to open a new TotalMix window.
Ctrl-W opens the dialog File Open of the operating system to load a TotalMix Workspace file.
The key W starts the dialog Workspace Quick Select for a direct selection or storage of up to 30
Workspaces.
The key M switches the active window to Mixer view. The key X switches the active window to
Matrix view. Ctrl-M opens a new Mixer window, Ctrl-X opens a new Matrix window. Another Ctrl-
M or Ctrl-X closes the new window again.
F1 opens the online help. The Level Meter setup dialog can be opened with F2 (same as in
DIGICheck). The dialog Preferences is opened with F3.
Alt-F4 closes the current window.
Alt and number keys 1 to 8 (not on the numeric keypad!) will load the corresponding Work-
space from the Workspace Quick Select feature (hotkey W).

21.10 Menu Options
Deactivate Screensaver: When active (checked) any activated Windows screensaver will be
disabled temporarily.
Always on Top: When active (checked) the TotalMix window will always be on top of the Win-
dows desktop.
Note: This function may result in problems with windows containing help text, as the TotalMix
window will even be on top of those windows, so the help text isn't readable.
Enable MIDI / OSC Control: Activates external MIDI control of the TotalMix mixer. In Mackie
Protocol mode the channels which are currently under MIDI control are indicated by a colour
change of the name field.
Submix linked to MIDI / OSC control (1-4). The 8-channel group follows the currently selected
submix, means Hardware Output, when a different submix is chosen on the remote as well as
when doing this in TotalMix. When using multiple windows it can be useful to deactivate this
feature for specific windows. The view will not change then.
Preferences: Opens a dialog to configure several functions of the level meters and the mixer.
See chapter 21.7.
Settings. Opens a dialog to configure several functions like Talkback, Listenback, Main Out and
MIDI Remote Control. See chapter 21.8.
Channel Layout. Opens a dialog to hide channels visually and from remote. See chapter 21.5.
Key Commands. Opens a dialog to configure the computer’s keyboard keys F4 to F8. This
dialog can also be used to change the function of the buttons A, B, OUT, SET and DIM of the
Babyface Pro.
Reset Mix. Offers several options to reset the mixer state:
 Straight playback with all to Main Out. All Playback channels are routed 1:1 to the Hard-
ware Outputs. Simultaneously all playbacks are mixed down to the Main Out. The faders in
the third row are not changed.
 Straight Playback. All Playback channels are routed 1:1 to the Hardware outputs. The fad-
ers in the third row are not changed.
 Clear all submixes. Deletes all submixes.
 Clear channel effects. Switches off all EQs, Low Cuts, Reverb, Echo and Stereo Width and
sets their knobs to default position.
 Set output volumes. All third row faders will be set to 0 dB, Main and Speaker B to -10 dB.
 Reset channel names. Removes all names assigned by the user.
 Set all channels mono. Reconfigures all TotalMix FX channels to mono mode.
 Set all channels stereo. Reconfigures all TotalMix FX channels to stereo mode.
 Set inputs mono / outputs stereo (ADM). Preferred setup for best ASIO Direct Monitoring
compatibility. In most cases mono hardware outputs will break ADM. Mono inputs are in
most cases compatible. If not wrong panning might occur.
User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME 65
 Total Reset. Playback routing 1:1 with mixdown to Main Out. Switches off all other func-
tions.
21.11 Menu Window
Zoom Options 100%, 135%, 200%. Depending on the size of the monitor and the current reso-
lution TotalMix FX might be much too small and the controls too tiny to easily operate them.
Together with the 2 Row mode these options give a lot of different window sizes that suit all
monitors and resolutions currently existing.
Hide Control Strip. Shifts the Control Strip out of the visible area to gain more space for other
elements.
22. The Matrix
22.1 Overview
The mixer window of TotalMix looks and operates similar to mixing desks, as it is based on a
conventional stereo design. The matrix display presents a different method of assigning and
routing channels, based on a single channel or monaural design. The matrix view of the Baby-
face Pro has the look and works like a conventional patchbay, adding functionality way beyond
comparable hardware and software solutions. While most patchbays will allow you to connect
inputs to outputs with just the original level (1:1, or 0 dB, as known from mechanical patchbays),
TotalMix allows you to use a freely definable gain value per crosspoint.
Matrix and TotalMix are different ways of displaying the same processes. Because of this both
views are always fully synchronized. Each change in one view is immediately reflected in the
other view as well.
22.2 Elements of the Matrix View
The visual design of the TotalMix Matrix is mainly determined by the architecture of the Baby-
face Pro system:
 Horizontal labels. All hardware outputs
 Vertical labels. All hardware inputs. Below are
all playback channels.
 Green 0.0 dB field. Standard 1:1 routing
 Dark grey field with number. Shows the current
gain value as dB
 Blue field. This routing is muted
 Red field. Phase 180° (inverted)
 Dark grey field. No routing.
To maintain overview when the window size has been reduced, the labels are floating. They
won't leave the visible area when scrolling.
A right mouse click on the labels brings up the context menu with the exact same options as in
the mixer view: Copy / Mirror / Paste /Clear input channels, submixes and FX settings.
66 User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME
22.3 Operation
Using the Matrix is a breeze. It is very easy to indentify the current crosspoint, because the outer
labels light up in orange according to the mouse position.
 If input 1 is to be routed to output 1, use the mouse and click one time on crosspoint In 1 /
AN 1 with held down Ctrl key. Two green 0.0 dB field pop in, another click removes them.
 To change the gain (equals the use of a different fader position, see simultaneous display of
the mixer view), drag the mouse up or down, starting from the gain field. The value within
the field changes accordingly. The corresponding fader in the mixer view is moving simulta-
neously, in case the currently modified routing is visible.
 On the right side is the Control Strip from the mixer window, adapted to the Matrix. The but-
ton for the temporary fader group is missing as well as all View options, as they don’t make
sense here. Instead the button Mono Mode lets you decide whether all the actions per-
formed in the Matrix are valid for two channels or just one.
The Matrix not always replaces the mixer view, but it significantly enhances the routing capabili-
ties and - more important - is a brilliant way to get a fast overview of all active routings. It shows
you in a glance what's going on. And since the Matrix can operate monaural, it is very easy to
set up specific routings with specific gains.
23. Tips and Tricks
23.1 ASIO Direct Monitoring (Windows)
Programs that support ADM (ASIO Direct Monitoring - Samplitude, Sequoia, Cubase, Nuendo
etc.) send control commands to TotalMix. This is directly shown by TotalMix. When a fader is
moved in the ASIO host the corresponding fader in TotalMix will move too. TotalMix reflects all
ADM gain and pan changes in real-time.
But: the faders only move when the currently activated routing (the selected submix) corre-
sponds to the routing in the ASIO host. The Matrix on the other hand will show any change, as it
shows all possible routings in one view. For best ADM compatibility use mono inputs and stereo
outputs. This setup can be activated globally under Options, Reset Mix.
23.2 Copy a Submix
TotalMix allows you to copy complete submixes to other outputs. In case a complex submix is
needed with only a few changes on a different output, the whole submix can be copied to that
output. Right click with the mouse on the original submix output (Hardware Output). In the con-
text menu select Copy Submix. Then right click on the new submix output, choose Paste Sub-
mix in the context menu. Now fine tune the submix.
23.3 Doubling the Output Signal (Mirror)
If a mix should be sent out via two (or more) different hardware outputs simply mirror that mix to
any number of other outputs. A right click on the original output brings up the option to
Copy/Mirror <name>. Another right click on the new output, then selecting Mirror of Output
<name> will paste the whole submix and then synchronize it automatically to any future chang-
es. The outputs now always send out the same signals, but their main volume (fader) and the
EQ and Dynamics settings stay fully independent.
23.4 Delete a Submix
The easiest and quickest way to delete complex routings is by selection of the according output
channel in the mixer view by a right mouse click, and selection of Clear Submix. As TotalMix FX
includes an unlimited undo the delete process can be undone without any problem.

23.5 Copy and Paste everywhere
The above three tips use functions found in the right click context menu available on all channels
of the TotalMix FX mixer view. These menus are also available in the Matrix, but only directly on
the channel labels. They are self-explanatory and automatically adjust to where the click is per-
formed. The input channels offer Clear, Copy input, Paste the input mix and Paste its FX. On a
playback channel Copy, Paste and Clear the playback mix are available. On an output channel
Copy and Mirror functionality for the current submix and copying of the FX settings is offered.
These options are very advanced and mighty tools to quickly do the impossible. Still there is no
need to fear breaking something, as a simple click (or several) on the Undo button will get you
back to where you started!
23.6 Recording a Submix - Loopback
TotalMix includes an internal loopback function, from the Hardware Outputs to the recording
software. Instead of the signal at the hardware input, the signal at the hardware output is sent to
the record software. This way, submixes can be recorded without an external loopback cable.
Also the playback from a software can be recorded by another software.
The function is activated by the Loopback button in the Settings panel of the Hardware Outputs.
In loopback mode, the signal at the hardware input of the corresponding channel is no longer
sent to the recording software, but still passed through to TotalMix. Therefore TotalMix can be
used to route this input signal to any hardware output. Using the subgroup recording, the input
can still be recorded on a different channel.
As each of the 6 stereo hardware outputs can be routed to the record software, and none of
these hardware inputs get lost, TotalMix offers an overall flexibility and performance not rivalled
by any other solution.
The risk of feedbacks, a basic problem of loopback methods, is low, because the feedback can
not happen within the mixer, only when the audio software is switched into monitoring mode.
68 User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME
The block diagram shows how the software's input signal is played back, and fed back from the
Hardware Output to the software input.
The block diagram also shows why with activated Loopback the EQ of the Hardware Output is
now within the record path. The setting DSP – EQ for Record is still working and can be used to
activate/deactivate LC/EQ here as well.
Recording a Software's playback
In real world application, recording a software's output with another software will show the follow-
ing problem: The record software tries to open the same playback channel as the playback soft-
ware (already active), or the playback one has already opened the input channel which should
be used by the record software.
This problem can easily be solved. First make sure that all rules for proper multi-client operation
are met (not using the same record/playback channels in both programs). Then route the play-
back signal via TotalMix to a hardware output in the range of the record software, and activate
Loopback for recording.
Mixing several input signals into one record channel
In some cases it is useful to record several sources into only one track. For example when using
two microphones recording instruments and loudspeakers, TotalMix' Loopback mode saves an
external mixing desk. Simply route/mix the input signals to the same output (third row), then
redefine this output into a record channel via Loopback. This way any number of input channels
from different sources can be recorded into one single track.
23.7 MS Processing
The mid/side principle is a special positioning technique for microphones, which results in a mid
signal on one channel and a side signal on the other channel. These information can be trans-
formed back into a stereo signal quite easily. The process sends the monaural mid channel to
left and right, the side channel too, but phase inverted (180°) to the right channel. For a better
understanding: the mid channel represents the function L+R, while the side channel represents
L-R.
During record the monitoring needs to be done in 'conventional' stereo. Therefore TotalMix also
offers the functionality of a M/S-decoder. Activation is done in the Settings panel of the Hard-
ware Input and Software Playback channels via the MS Proc button.
The M/S-Processing automatically operates as M/S encoder or
decoder, depending on the source signal format. When pro-
cessing a usual stereo signal, all monaural information will be
shifted into the left channel, all stereo information into the right
channel. Thus the stereo signal is M/S encoded. This yields some
interesting insights into the mono/stereo contents of modern mu-
sic productions. Additionally some very interesting methods of
manipulating the stereo base and generating stereo effects come
up, as it is then very easy to process the side channel with Low
Cut, Expander, Compressor or Delay.
The most basic application is the manipulation of the stereo width: a change of the level of the
side channel allows to manipulate the stereo width from mono to stereo up to extended.

24. MIDI Remote Control
24.1 Overview
TotalMix can be remote controlled via MIDI. It is compatible to the widely spread Mackie Control
protocol, so TotalMix can be controlled with all hardware controllers supporting this standard.
Examples are the Mackie Control, Tascam US-2400 or Behringer BCF 2000.
Additionally, the stereo output faders (lowest row) which are set up as Main Out in the Control
Room section can also be controlled by the standard Control Change Volume via MIDI chan-
nel 1. With this, the main volume of the Babyface Pro is controllable from nearly any MIDI
equipped hardware device.
MIDI Remote Control always operates in View Submix mode, even when the View Option Free
is currently selected in TotalMix FX.
24.2 Mapping
TotalMix supports the following Mackie Control surface elements*:

24.3 Setup
Open the Preferences dialog (menu Options or F3). Select the MIDI Input and MIDI Output port
where your controller is connected to.
When no feedback is needed select NONE as MIDI Output.
Check Enable MIDI Control in the Options menu.
24.4 Operation
The channels being under Mackie MIDI control are indicated by a colour change of the name
field, black turns to brown.
The 8-fader block can be moved horizontally and vertically, in steps of one or eight channels.
In Submix View mode, the current routing destination (output bus) can be selected via REC Ch.
1 – 8. This equals the selection of a different output channel in the lowest row by a mouse click
when in Submix View. In MIDI operation it is not necessary to jump to the lowest row to perform
this selection. This way even the routing can be easily changed via MIDI.
Full LC Display Support: This option in Preferences (F3) activates complete Mackie Control LCD
support with eight channel names and eight volume/pan values. When Full LC Display Support
is turned off, a brief information about the first fader of the block (channel and row) is sent. This
brief information is also available on the LED display of the Behringer BCF2000.
Disable MIDI in Background (menu Options, Settings) disables the MIDI control as soon as an-
other application is in the focus, or in case TotalMix has been minimized. This way the hardware
controller will control the main DAW application only, except when TotalMix is in the foreground.
Often the DAW application can be set to become inactive in background too, so that MIDI con-
trol is switched between TotalMix and the application automatically when switching between both
applications.
TotalMix also supports the 9th fader of the Mackie Control. This fader (labelled Master) will con-
trol the stereo output fader (lowest row) which is set up as Main Out in the Control Room sec-
tion.
Extender support (Settings, tab MIDI) enables the use of the special Extender mixing desk, but
also the addition of any other Mackie compatible remote. Setting the main remote as number 2
and the extender as number 1 will cause the extender to be on the left side. Using this function
the remotes will be shown as one fader block and navigate as one.
User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME 71
24.5 MIDI Control
The hardware output set up as Main Out can be controlled by the standard Control Change
Volume via MIDI channel 1. With this, the main volume of the Babyface Pro is controllable from
nearly any MIDI equipped hardware device.
Even if you don't want to control all faders and pans, some buttons are highly desirable to be
available in 'hardware'. These are mainly the Talkback and the Dim button, and the monitoring
options (listen to Phones submixes). Fortunately a Mackie Control compatible controller is not
required to control these buttons, as they are steered by simple Note On/Off commands on MIDI
channel 1.
The notes are (hex / decimal / keys):
Dim: 5D / 93 / A 6
Mono: 2A / 42 / #F 2
Talkback: 5E / 94 / #A 6
Recall: 5F / 95 / H 6
Speaker B: 32 / 50 / D3
Cue Main Out: 3E / 62 / D 4
Cue Phones 1: 3F / 63 / #D 4
Cue Phones 2: 40 / 64 / E 4
Snapshot 1: 36 / 54 / #F 3
Snapshot 2: 37 / 55 / G 3
Snapshot 3: 38 / 56 / #G 3
Snapshot 4: 39 / 57 / A 3
Snapshot 5: 3A / 58 / #A 3
Snapshot 6: 3B / 59 / B 3
Snapshot 7: 3C / 60 / C 4
Snapshot 8: 3D / 61 / #C 4
Trim Gains: 2D / 45 / A 2
Master Mute: 2C / 44 / #G2
Master Solo: 2B / 43 / G2
Furthermore all faders of all three rows can be controlled via simple Control Change com-
mands. The format for the Control Change commands is:
Bx yy zz
x = MIDI channel
yy = control number
zz = value
The first row in TotalMix is addressed by MIDI channels 1 up to 4, the middle row by channels 5
up to 8 and the bottom row by channels 9 up to 12.
16 Controller numbers are used: 102 up to 117 (= hex 66 to 75). With these 16 Controllers (=
faders) and 4 MIDI channels each per row, up to 64 faders can be controlled per row (as re-
quired by the HDSPe MADI).
72 User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME
Examples for sending MIDI strings:
- Set input 1 to 0 dB: B0 66 68
- Set input 5 to maximum attenuation: B1 6A 0
- Set playback 1 to maximum: B4 66 7F
- Set Output 3 to 0 dB: B8 68 68
Note: Sending MIDI strings requires the use of programmer's logic for the MIDI channel, starting
with 0 for channel 1 and ending with 15 for channel 16.
Further functions:
- Trim Gains On: BC 66 xx (BC = MIDI channel 13, xx = any value)
- Trim Gains Off: BC 66 xx or select a submix
Select submix (fader) in third row:
- channel 1/2: BC 68/69 xx
- channel 3/4: BC 6A/6B xx
etc.
Input Gain control is available via CC9, value range as the gain itself (up to 65). The MIDI
channel determines the controlled channel, from 1 to 16 (Babyface Pro: only 1/2/3/4). For this to
work, Enable MIDI Control in the Options menu has to be activated.
The Reverb and Echo User Presets can be changed via MIDI CC: B2 0C nn for Reverb preset
1 to 16, B3 0C nn for Echo preset 1 to 16
24.6 Loopback Detection
The Mackie Control protocol requires feedback of the received commands, back to the hard-
ware controller. So usually TotalMix will be set up with both a MIDI input and MIDI output. Unfor-
tunately any small error in wiring and setup will cause a MIDI feedback loop here, which then
completely blocks the computer (the CPU).
To prevent the computer from freezing, TotalMix sends a special MIDI note every 0.5 seconds to
its MIDI output. As soon as it detects this special note at the input, the MIDI functionality is disa-
bled. After fixing the loopback, check Enable MIDI Control under Options to reactivate the To-
talMix MIDI.
24.7 OSC (Open Sound Control)
Besides simple MIDI notes, the Mackie Protocol and Control Change commands, TotalMix FX
can also be controlled by the Open Sound Control, OSC. For details on setup and usage see
chapter 21.8.3.
An OSC implementation chart can be downloaded from the RME website:
http://www.rme-audio.de/download/osc_table_totalmix.zip
RME offers a free iPad template for the iOS app TouchOSC (by Hexler, available in the Apple
App-Store):

The RME forum hosts further information, more templates (iPhone…) and lots of useful user
feedback.

25. DAW Mode
Users that work exclusively with their DAW software, and don’t want to use TotalMix FX for addi-
tional routing tasks, need a way to be sure that TotalMix FX currently doesn’t change the DAW’s
routing. While Reset Mix can do so, those users would be better served with a very simple sur-
face that offers the interface’s hardware controls (gain, phantom control, instrument…), but
guarantees a straight 1:1 routing for all playback channels, and has no hardware monitoring of
the input channels (which is then done by the DAW software).
For such cases TotalMix FX includes an alternative operating mode. It can be booted into the so
called DAW mode. This simplified interface is for anyone performing all monitoring and routing
within the DAW. The DAW mode restarts TM FX into a light version with just two rows, no play-
back row, and no mixing faders in the input row. Routing is 1:1 only. Just the hardware controls
(if existing) and hardware output levels are available.
To change the current mode go to the menu, Options, and click on Operational Mode. Choices
are Full Mode (default, mixer active, all routing options available), and Digital Audio Workstation
Mode (straight playback routing, no input mix).
Several useful, advanced features are still available in TotalMix FX in DAW mode:
 Talkback, External Input
 Phones definition and handling with Talkback
 Speaker A / B
 Mute and Solo
 Cue / PFL

26. TotalMix Remote
TotalMix Remote is a remote control for TotalMix FX v1.50 and up, to control the hardware mix-
er and effects in RME audio interfaces. TotalMix Remote mirrors the current state of the host
system on the iPad and Windows/Mac computers - the entire mixing state, the complete routing,
all FX settings, up to the level meters, and everything in real-time. TotalMix Remote supports up
to three hosts with multiple interfaces each, allowing Apple's popular iPad and Windows/Mac
computers to adjust all the mixer and FX settings from a distance, via Ethernet and WiFi.
Supported Hardware
TotalMix Remote communicates with TotalMix FX 1.50 or up. Any RME hardware that can be
used with TotalMix FX is supported automatically.
Quick Start
On the host (the computer with the connected audio interface) go to the TotalMix FX menu Op-
tions, Network Remote Settings. Click Enable TotalMix Remote Server to start this service. Un-
der Windows a Firewall warning will come up. Allow TotalMix FX or it won't work. This dialog
also shows the host's IP, like 192.168.1.45.
Make sure both host and remote computer /
iPad reside in the same network. Start To-
talMix Remote on the remote computer /
iPad (not on the host!). On the iPad, tap on
the gear symbol in the upper right corner,
then on Host Connection Settings. On Win-
dows / Mac either the dialog comes up au-
tomatically or can be called from the Search
Connected Hosts dialog. Type in the host's
IP address (like 192.168.1.45) into the IP
field of Host Connection 1, and make sure it
is activated. The port defaults to 7009 and
usually must not be changed. In case this
port is unexpectedly occupied a warning
message will be issued. Choose a different
port then. Under Windows a Firewall warn-
ing will come up. Allow TotalMix Remote or
it won't work.
Tap Done on top or click Ok. In the mixer view the state should change from offline to connected
within a few seconds.
The Add button provides access to
the user-management that can be
configured in detail. Here users can
be defined, with and without a
password, and the rights can be
assigned to viewing only, changing
a specific sub-mix, or full access.
For example, using Total-Mix FX as
a monitor controller for all band
members, user-management pre-
vents the bassist from changing the
guitarist's monitor mix. Or the
drummer making himself too loud.
Etc.

Tip
The remotes have the option Sync Channel Layouts active as default (in Preferences). This
option transfers the Layout Presets and the current Channel Layout state from host to remote.
Apart from the channel width state this option makes a mirror-style setup most easy. But when
using the remote as individual setup, make sure to disable this option to have independent Lay-
out Presets on the remote.
Limitations
• Mixer View & GUI. When connected the remote computer / iPad will immediately have the
complete routing and FX settings of the host, including mono and stereo channels, but not the
host's GUI setup, like panel states open/closed of Settings/EQ/Dynamic, FX panel visibility, 2-
Row or 3-Row mode and channel width. Channel width states can be stored as usual per Snap-
shot and completely as Workspace, locally on the remote computer. They need to be loaded
manually after loading a Workspace on the host in case a 100% identical view is required.
• Workspaces. The Remote shows the Quick Workspaces (hotkey W on Windows/Mac) stored
on the host, and allows to remotely load them. It is not possible to save complete Workspaces
with mixer state from the Remote, or on the Remote. The Workspaces saved locally include GUI
information only (Channel state wide/narrow, Channel Layouts, window size and position) and
further local settings, to be able to have personalized views on the remote computer, independ-
ent from the view on the host.
• Real-time behaviour. Can suffer when the network is overloaded or the WiFi reception is insuf-
ficient. Level Meters will stutter then and faders do not move smoothly.
• Background operation on iPad - is not possible. This should not be a problem as the Remote
doesn't need to do anything in background, and when called up very quickly reconnects and
synchronizes its state.
• State. Is shown in the upper right corner (offline or connected), or the Mac/Windows title bar.

28. Technical Background
28.1 Lock and SyncCheck
Digital signals consist of a carrier and the data. If a digital signal is applied to an input, the re-
ceiver has to synchronize to the carrier clock in order to read the data correctly. To achieve this,
the receiver uses a PLL (Phase Locked Loop). As soon as the receiver meets the exact fre-
quency of the incoming signal, it is locked. This Lock state remains even with small changes of
the frequency, because the PLL tracks the receiver's frequency.
If an ADAT or SPDIF signal is applied to the Babyface Pro, the corresponding input LED starts
flashing. The unit indicates LOCK, i. e. a valid input signal (in case the signal is also in sync, the
LED is constantly lit, see below).
Unfortunately, LOCK does not necessarily mean that the received signal is correct with respect
to the clock which processes the read out of the embedded data. Example [1]: The Babyface
Pro is set to 44.1 kHz internally (clock mode Master), and a mixing desk with ADAT output is
connected to input ADAT. The corresponding LED will show LOCK immediately, but usually the
mixing desk's sample rate is generated internally (also Master), and thus slightly higher or lower
than the Babyface Pro's internal sample rate. Result: When reading out the data, there will fre-
quently be read errors that cause clicks and drop outs.
In order to display those problems optically at the device, the Babyface Pro includes Sync-
Check. It checks all clocks used for synchronicity. If they are not synchronous to each other (i.e.
absolutely identical) the SYNC LED flashes. In case they are completely synchronous the LED is
constantly lit. In the above example the user would have noticed quickly that the LED kept on
flashing after connecting the mixing desk.
The same information is presented in the Babyface Pro's Settings dialog. In the status display
Input State the state of the input clock is decoded and shown as simple text (No Lock, Lock,
Sync).
In practice, SyncCheck allows for a quick overview of the correct configuration of all digital de-
vices. So one of the most difficult and error-prone topics of the digital studio world finally be-
comes easy to handle.

28.2 Latency and Monitoring
The term Zero Latency Monitoring was introduced by RME in 1998 for the DIGI96 series of
audio cards. It stands for the ability to pass-through the computer's input signal at the interface
directly to the output. Since then, the idea behind has become one of the most important fea-
tures of modern hard disk recording. In the year 2000, RME published two ground-breaking
Tech Infos on the topics Low Latency Background, which are still up-to-date: Monitoring, ZLM
and ASIO, and Buffer and Latency Jitter, both found on the RME website.
How much Zero is Zero?
From a technical view there is no zero. Even the analog pass-through is subject to phase errors,
equalling a delay between input and output. However, delays below certain values can subjec-
tively be claimed to be zero latency. This applies to analog routing and mixing, and in our opinion
also to RME's Zero Latency Monitoring. The term describes the direct digital path from the inter-
face’s input to output. Digital receiver buffers plus TotalMix and output transmitter shoiw a typical
delay of 3 samples. At 44.1 kHz this equals about 68 µs (0.000068 s), at 192 kHz only 15 µs.
The delay is valid for ADAT and SPDIF in the same way.
Oversampling
While the delays of digital interfaces can be disregarded altogether, the analog inputs and out-
puts do cause a significant delay. Converter chips operate with 64 or 128 times oversampling
plus digital filtering. This typically generates a delay of one millisecond. A playback and re-record
of the same signal via DA and AD (loopback) causes an offset to the newly recorded track of
about 2 ms.
Low Latency!
The Babyface Pro uses AD/DA converters with latest digital filters, causing a delay of only a few
samples. With 12 samples AD and 7 samples DA the delay caused by the conversion is only
about a quarter of previous generations. The delays of the Babyface Pro’s AD/DA are:
Sample frequency kHz 44.1 48 88.2 96 176.4 192
AD (12.6 x 1/fs) ms 0.28 0.26
AD (12.6 x 1/fs) ms 0.14 0.13
AD (10 x 1/fs) ms 0.056 0.052
DA (7 x 1/fs) ms 0.16 0.15 0.08 0.07 0.04 0.036
Buffer Size (Latency)
Windows: This option found in the Settings dialog defines the size of the buffers for the audio
data used in ASIO and WDM (see chapter 10).
Mac OS X: The buffer size is defined within the application. Only some do not offer any setting.
For example iTunes is fixed to 512 samples.
General: A setting of 64 samples at 44.1 kHz causes a latency of 1.5 ms, for record and play-
back each. But when performing a digital loopback test no latency/offset can be detected. The
reason is that the software naturally knows the size of the buffers, therefore is able to position
the newly recorded data at a place equalling a latency-free system.
AD/DA Offset under ASIO and OS X: ASIO (Windows) and Core Audio (Mac OS X) allow for the
signalling of an offset value to correct buffer independent delays, like AD- and DA-conversion or
the Safety Buffer described below. An analog loopback test will then show no offset, because
the application shifts the recorded data accordingly. Because in real world operation analog rec-
ord and playback is unavoidable, the drivers include an offset value matching the Babyface Pro
converter delays.
Therefore, in a digital loopback test a negative offset of about 3 ms occurs. This is no real prob-
lem, because this way of working is more than rare, and usually the offset can be compensated
manually within the application. Additionally, keep in mind that even when using the digital I/Os
usually at some place an AD- and DA-conversion is involved (no sound without...).
82 User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME
Note: Cubase and Nuendo display the latency values signalled from the driver separately for
record and playback. The values do not exactly equal the buffer size (for example 3 ms at 128
samples), instead a higher value is shown, including the time needed for the AD/DA-conversion.
Playback shows an even higher value – see Safety Buffer.
Safety Buffer
An additional small Safety Buffer on the playback side has proven to be very efficient and useful.
The Babyface Pro uses a fixed additional buffer of 32 samples, which is added to the current
buffer size. The main advantage is the ability to use lowest latency at highest CPU loads. Fur-
thermore, the fixed buffer does not add to the latency jitter (see Tech Info), the subjective timing
is extraordinary.
Core Audio's Safety Offset
Under OS X, every audio interface has to use a so called Safety Offset on record and playback,
otherwise Core Audio won't operate click-free. The Babyface Pro uses a Safety Offset of 16
samples. This offset is signalled to the system, and the software can calculate and display the
total latency of buffer size plus AD/DA offset plus 2 x Safety Offset plus Safety Buffer for the
current sample rate.
28.3 USB Audio
USB audio is in several ways different from PCI based audio interfaces. A Babyface Pro can
achieve a performance similar to a PCI or PCI Express card when used with an optimal PC. Low
CPU load and click-free operation even at 48 samples buffer size are indeed possible on current
computers. However, using older computers a simple stereo playback will begin to cause a CPU
load of more than 30%.
A computer blocked for a short time – no matter if ASIO or WDM – will lose one or more data
packets. Such problems can only be solved by increasing the buffer size (and with this the laten-
cy).
The Babyface Pro features a unique data
checking, detecting errors during transmis-
sion via USB and displaying them in the
Settings dialog.
Additionally the Babyface Pro provides a special mechanism to continue recording and playback
in case of drop-outs, and to correct the sample position in real-time.
Like any audio interface the Babyface Pro should have a data transmission to the computer as
undisturbed as possible. The easiest way to guarantee this is to connect it to its own bus, which
should be no big problem as most USB 2.0 interfaces are a double bus design. A check in the
Device Manager can be done as follows:
 Connect the Babyface Pro to a USB port
 Start the Device Manager, View set to Devices by Connection
 Select ACPI x86-based PC, Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System, expand PCI Bus
This branch normally includes two entries of a USB2 Enhanced Host Controller. A USB Root
Hub can be seen, which then connects all USB devices, including the Babyface Pro. By recon-
necting to a different port this view immediately shows at which of the two controllers the Baby-
face Pro is connected. With multiple devices it can also be checked if they are connected to the
same controller.
Furthermore this information can be used to operate an external USB drive without disturbing
the Babyface Pro, by simply connecting the drive to the other controller.
User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME 83
Especially with notebooks it can happen that all internal devices and all the sockets/ports are
connected to the same controller, with the second controller not used at all. In that case all de-
vices have to use the same bus and interfere with each other.
28.4 DS - Double Speed
When activating the Double Speed mode the Babyface Pro operates at double sample rate. The
internal clock 44.1 kHz turns to 88.2 kHz, 48 kHz to 96 kHz. The internal resolution is still 24 bit.
Sample rates above 48 kHz were not always taken for granted, and are still not widely used be-
cause of the CD format (44.1 kHz) dominating everything. Before 1998 there were no receiv-
er/transmitter circuits available that could receive or transmit more than 48 kHz. Therefore a
work-around was used: instead of two channels, one AES line only carries one channel with its
odd and even samples being distributed to the former left and right channels. By this, you get the
double amount of data, i. e. also double sample rate. Of course in order to transmit a stereo
signal two AES/EBU ports are necessary then.
This transmission mode is called Double Wire in the professional studio world, and is also
known as S/MUX (Sample Multiplexing) in connection with the ADAT format.
Not before February 1998, Crystal shipped the first 'single wire' receiver/transmitters that could
also work with double sample rate. It was then possible to transmit two channels of 96 kHz data
via one AES/EBU port.
But Double Wire is still far from being dead. On one hand, there are still many devices which
can't handle more than 48 kHz, e. g. digital tape recorders. But also other common interfaces
like ADAT or TDIF are still using this technique.
Because the ADAT interface does not allow for sampling frequencies above 48 kHz (a limitation
of the interface hardware), the Babyface Pro automatically uses Sample Multiplexing in DS
mode. One channel's data is distributed to two channels according to the following table:
Analog In 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
DS Signal
Port
1/2
ADAT
3/4
ADAT
5/6
ADAT
7/8
ADAT
- - -
As the transmission of double rate signals is done at standard sample rate (Single Speed), the
ADAT output still delivers 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz.
28.5 QS – Quad Speed
Due to the small number of available devices that use sample rates up to 192 kHz, but even
more due to a missing real world application (CD...), Quad Speed has had no broad success so
far. An implementation of the ADAT format as double S/MUX results in only two channels per
optical output. There are few devices using this method.
In Quad Speed mode the Babyface Pro automatically uses Sample Multiplexing. One channel's
data is distributed to four channels according to the following table:
Analog In 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
DS Signal
Port
1/2/3/4
ADAT
5/6/7/8
ADAT
- - - - - -
As the transmission of quad rate signals is done at standard sample rate (Single Speed), the
ADAT output still delivers 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz.
84 User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME
28.6 Noise Level in DS / QS Mode
The outstanding signal to noise ratio of the Babyface Pro's AD-converters can be verified even
without expensive test equipment, by using record level meters of various software. But when
activating the DS and QS mode, the displayed noise level will rise from -113 dB to -105 dB at 96
kHz, and –79 dB at 192 kHz. This is not a failure. The software measures the noise of the whole
frequency range, at 96 kHz from 0 Hz to 48 kHz (RMS unweighted), at 192 kHz from 0 Hz to 96
kHz.
When limiting the measurement range from 20 Hz to 20 kHz (so called audio bandpass) the
value would be -113 dB again. This can be verified with RME's DIGICheck. The function Bit
Statistic & Noise measures the noise floor by Limited Bandwidth, ignoring DC and ultrasound.
The reason for this behaviour is the noise shaping technology of the analog to digital converters.
They move all noise and distortion to the inaudible higher frequency range, above 24 kHz. That’s
how they achieve their outstanding performance and sonic clarity. Therefore the noise is slightly
increased in the ultrasound area. High-frequency noise has high energy. Add the doubled (quad-
rupled) bandwidth, and a wideband measurement will show a significant drop in SNR, while the
human ear will notice absolutely no change in the audible noise floor.
28.7 SteadyClock
The further improved SteadyClock III technology of the Babyface Pro guarantees an excellent
performance in all clock modes. Thanks to a highly efficient jitter suppression, the AD- and DA-
conversion always operates on highest sonic level, being completely independent from the quali-
ty of the incoming clock signal.
SteadyClock has been originally de-
veloped to gain a stable and clean
clock from the heavily jittery MADI data
signal (the embedded MADI clock
suffers from about 80 ns jitter). Using
the Babyface Pro's input signals
SPDIF and ADAT, you'll most probably
never experience such high jitter val-
ues. But SteadyClock is not only ready
for them, it would handle them just on
the fly.
Common interface jitter values in real
world applications are below 10 ns, a
very good value is less than 2 ns.
The screenshot shows an extremely jittery SPDIF signal of about 50 ns jitter (top graph, yellow).
SteadyClock turns this signal into a clock with less than 2 ns jitter (lower graph, blue). The signal
processed by SteadyClock is of course not only used internally, but also used to clock the digital
output. Therefore the refreshed and jitter-cleaned signal can be used as reference clock without
hesitation.

29.2 Connector Pinouts
TS jack analog instrument input
The 1/4" TS jacks of the universal line/instrument inputs are wired according to international
standards:
Tip = + (hot), Ring = GND, Sleeve = GND.
XLR Connectors
The XLR sockets of the analog I/Os are wired according to international standards:
1 = GND (Shield), 2 = + (hot), 3 = - (cold).
The servo-balanced input circuitry allows to use monaural TS jacks (unbalanced) with no loss in
level. This is the same as when using a TRS-jack with ring connected to ground.
The electronic output stage does not operate servo-balanced! When connecting unbal-
anced equipment, make sure pin 3 of the XLR output is not connected. A connection to
ground might cause higher THD (distortion) and power consumption!
TRS Phones jack
The output channels 3/4 feed the two
Phones outputs via two independent
driver circuits, optimized for high (TRS
1/4”, 6.35mm) and low impedance
(TRS 1/8”, 3.5mm) headphones
In case this output should operate as
Line output, an adapter TRS plug to
RCA phono plugs, or TRS plug to TS
plugs is required.
The pin assignment follows interna-
tional standards. The left channel is
connected to the tip, the right channel
to the ring of the TRS jack/plug.

Babyface Pro
Stand-Alone and Class Compliant Mode
88 User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME
30. General
The Babyface Pro operates in three different modes: driver-based USB 2 (Windows, Mac OS
X), stand-alone mode (without being connected to a computer), and Class Compliant mode,
mainly for iPad® connectivity. The latter describes a standard that is natively supported by oper-
ating systems like Mac OS X and Linux. No proprietary drivers are required, the device will be
directly recognized when CC mode is activated. Obviously, native features will be limited in
comparison to those provided by the RME driver set. For example there will be no (Total) Mix
and no effects. However, on the iPad (iOS) the Babyface Pro can be fully controlled by the op-
tional app TotalMix FX for iPad.
The Babyface Pro provides the iPad with the professional analog I/O connections it lacks. Su-
perb microphone preamps, in addition to professional balanced line outputs, and a hi-power
headphone output that excels with both high and low impedance headphones. Plus gain and
level adjustments, SPDIF and ADAT input and output, at up to 192 kHz and 24 bit. And of
course a Sysex capable MIDI I/O.
In stand-alone mode the Babyface Pro needs to be powered. You have the choice to use USB
bus power by one of the numerous LiPo batteries with USB ports, sold as mobile power for your
smartphone and iPad, or an external power supply.
In Class Compliant mode connected to an iPad the Babyface Pro needs to be operated with an
external standard power supply, like the ones provided by RME ( 9 to 12 Volts and around 1 A).
For mobile applications please note that LiPo batteries are also available in advanced versions
which offer a 9 to 12 V output.
The Babyface Pro features no automatic power on/off due to its low idle power consumption of
below 3 Watts.
31. System requirements for iPad Operation
 Babyface Pro with external power supply and activated Class Compliant mode
 Any Apple iPad with at least iOS 6 or an iPhone with at least iOS 7
 Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit or Lightning to USB adapter
32. Class Compliant Operation
Activation of the Class Compliant mode
Hold down the SELECT and DIM button until the level meters show CC, confirming CC mode is
activated. CC mode is shown on the level meters on every power-on of the unit. When nothing is
shown then the unit is in PC mode.
Using an external power supply and USB disconnected the mode can be changed back and
forth between CC and PC. In this case PC is shown on the level meters after the reconfiguration.
Connect the USB cable to the Camera Connection Kit/Lightning adapter. Start the iPad and plug
the Kit/adapter into the iPad’s socket. If everything works as expected, the unit will be used for
all audio I/O. Audio playback in iTunes will automatically be performed by the Babyface Pro,
using analog outputs 1/2, and - with Copy mode - active on phones outputs 3/4 and
SPDIF/ADAT.
Apps that support MIDI and are ready for Core MIDI (available since iOS 4.2) will offer dialogs to
select the desired Babyface Pro MIDI input and output.
User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME 89
32.1 Useful hints
If the unit is not in CC mode, the iPad will detect an incompati-
ble USB device, and display a message saying “Cannot Use
Device – The connected USB device is not supported”.
When the power supply for the Babyface Pro is insufficient, iOS will complain about the attached
unit drawing too much power.
The iPad's volume control is inactive during USB operation.
If the unit does not enter Host mode: Remove and reconnect the Connection Kit.
Since 2016 Apple offers another version of the USB to Lightning Adapter, called Lightning to
USB 3 Camera Adapter. It has an additional Lightning port for power supply that charges the
iPhone/iPad even when used with the Babyface Pro.
32.2 Class Compliant Mode under Windows and Mac OS X
On a Windows PC, Class Compliant mode is indicated by a missing “RME“ in the device name
shown in the Device Manager. In the correct mode (PC) and with installed drivers, the full name
including RME is shown, without serial number.
Mac OS X supports Class Compliant USB Audio 2.0, even with more than 2 channels. The
Babyface offers full 12 input and 12 output channels at up to 192 kHz. It is shown as “Babyface
Pro (xxxxxxxx)“ in the Audio MIDI Setup, in both PC and CC mode. In CC mode the USB Set-
tings will vanish from the Dock, and TotalMix FX will not start, or show a ‘disconnected’ Baby-
face Pro.
The Audio window in the Audio MIDI Setup lists two available modes: 2 channels and 12 chan-
nels. The sample rate shown here as ‘Default’ is the one set at the Babyface Pro.
90 User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME
33. Supported Inputs and Outputs
33.1 Class Compliant Mode
In Mac OS X, either the first two or all channels will work, depending on the choice in the Audio
MIDI Setup. The playback signal of channels 1/2 can be copied to outputs 3/4 and SPDIF/ADAT
by activating the Copy Mode (see chapter 34).
When connected to an iPad, the analog mic/line input 1 works with mono apps, inputs 1 and 2
with stereo apps (both dual mono and stereo), and up to 8 inputs with 8-channel applications like
MultiTrack DAW and Music Studio. Garage Band supports all 12 inputs, but only two at a time.
Auria and Cubasis can record all 12 inputs simultaneously.
Playback will use analog outputs 1 and 2, or even more channels if the app supports such oper-
ation. The Babyface Pro onboard mixer can copy the output signal 1/2 to outputs 3/4, SPDIF and
ADAT simultaneously, see chapter 34 - Copy Mode.
In Class Compliant mode the default clock mode is AutoSync at 44.1 kHz. The Babyface Pro
(and with it the iPad) will be synchronized to an external digital sample rate if there is a valid
digital input signal. With a wrong sample rate heavy audio noise will occur. Without an SPDIF or
ADAT input signal the Babyface Pro enters master mode and uses the sample rate set by Mac
OS X or iOS (the app in use). The Babyface Pro can be set to fixed Master mode as well, but
the set sample rate is ignored, as the iPad (the current app) controls the sample rate value.
While the MIDI I/Os will send and receive Sysex messages, not all apps are ready to do this.
The app Midi Tool Box can be used to verify that the Babyface Pro is working correctly, and the
problem lies somewhere else.
33.2 Stand-Alone Mode
Switching on the unit without being connected to USB activates stand-alone mode, no matter if
the unit has been set to PC or CC mode before. In this mode the unit offers extensive configura-
tion options, like clocking and routing/mixing, that turn it into lots of useful, hi-quality tools. Ex-
amples are a 2 channel microphone preamp with analog and digital output, a headphone amp
with analog and digital inputs, and many more.
The clock modes are the same as in CC mode, but here the chosen sample rate is indeed used
by the unit. To recap what AutoSync means:
- Without further configuration and no digital input signal, it will default to 44.1 kHz internal sam-
ple rate.
- When receiving a digital input signal in SPDIF format, it will sync itself on the external sample
rate, from 32 kHz to 192 kHz.
- When receiving a digital input signal in ADAT format, it will sync itself on the external sample
rate, from 32 to 48 kHz. Double Speed mode is automatically set when receiving an ADAT signal
from other RME devices. Otherwise the setting has to be performed manually (see next chap-
ter).
The input signals can be routed/mixed to the outputs by activating the unit’s Mix mode:
 Use OUT to select the desired output
 Use IN to select the input with the desired signal source
 Push MIX. The input LEDs start to flash.
 Use SELECT to choose between left, right or both input channels
 Turn the big knob to set the actual monitoring/routing level
 Continue with all inputs and outputs as you wish

!
While the setup is simplified (no panorama available) it is still very efficient and will address most
needs. Also a different input can be mixed onto the same output.
Of the eight ADAT channels only channels 1/2 can be controlled from the Babyface Pro.
All settings are stored within the unit and do not get lost until the next time stand-alone mode
is used.
34. Operation at the Unit
Operation at the unit is very similar to the one under Windows and OS X, with some additions.
These were done as intuitive and easy to remember as possible.
Changing between normal and CC mode
When connected to a Windows or Mac computer, the USB data connection prevents switching
the mode. In such a case it is possible only during power-up to be able to revert from CC to
normal mode:
Hold down the keys SELECT and DIM while inserting the USB cable. During the boot process
the level meters show CC for about 2 seconds, confirming the CC mode has been activated.
The Babyface Pro stays in CC mode until this procedure has been performed again, it will then
show PC.
When not connected to a Windows or Mac computer, the mode can be changed any time.
Therefore, with USB bus power (via LiPo battery) or when connected to an external power sup-
ply: Hold down the keys SELECT and DIM for two seconds. The level meters will show the new
mode, either PC or CC. Hold them down again to change back.
CC mode is shown on every boot of the unit. PC mode is shown only during the switching pro-
cess.
DIM
Select Ch 1/2, Phones or Opt via OUT, then push the DIM button. DIM can be used on any of
the three outputs, and applies a fixed attenuation of 20 dB.
48V Phantom power on/off
Use IN to select Ch 1/2. Use SELECT to choose left, right or both channels. A push on SET will
activate Phantom power and turn on the orange LED labeled P48.
Copy Mode (Playback Output Routing for iOS)
A stereo playback of iPad/iPhone defaults to output channels 1/2. To hear the audio also at the
Phones output, or even at the SPDIF/ADAT output, the Babyface includes an optional Copy
mode, where the playback signal of channels 1/2 is copied to outputs 3/4 and channels 1/2 of
SPDIF/ADAT.
Use OUT to select OUTPUT Ch 1/2. Push SET. The current state of the Copy mode is shown by
the three OUTPUT state LEDs:
 Only Ch 1/2 lit: Copy Mode not active
 Ch 1/2, Phones and Opt lit: Copy mode active.
Use SELECT to turn Copy mode on and off.
Copy mode is not available when TotalMix FX for iPad is detected by the Babyface Pro.
92 User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME
!
Switch digital output format (SPDIF <> ADAT)
Use OUT to select the optical output (Opt.). Push SET. The level meter will signal ADAT mode
with 8 LEDs, SPDIF mode with 2 LEDs turned on. Use SELECT to switch between them.
Set Clock Mode and Sample Rate
Push SET for two seconds. The level meters will now signal the current clock mode and sample
rate. Use SELECT to step through all available options:
Master 44.1 kHz
Master 48 kHz
Master 88.2 kHz
Master 96 kHz
Master 176.4 kHz
Master 192 kHz
AutoSync
AutoSync, Double Speed mode in case input = ADAT (2x SMUX)
AutoSync, Quad Speed mode in case input = ADAT (4x SMUX)
Thanks to the four level meters all settings are shown in an intuitive and easy to ‘decode’ way.
Master 44.1 kHz is signaled with no LED lit in the first level meter, 4 in the second and third, and
1 LED in the fourth. So the meters show 0441. Master 176.4 kHz is shown as 1 LED, 7, 6 and 4
LEDs - 1764.
The AutoSync modes cover the single, double and quad speed frequency range, and are sig-
naled as 1 bar, 2 bars or 4 bars respectively.
Set Clock Mode and Sample Rate can be exit by any of the 4 buttons below the level meters.
In CC mode, the sample rate value is ignored, as it is set by the app currently used on the iPad.
Still the unit can be set into fixed clock mode ‘master’ by selecting one of the Master settings.
This setting can be quite useful. When pulling the cable from the iPad, the Babyface Pro imme-
diately enters stand-alone mode – and would turn to the user-preferred sample rate.
Monitoring – MIX
The Babyface Pro uses TotalMix technology for routing/mixing in all modes. Setup:
 Use OUT to select the output for the monitoring, i.e. where the signal will be routed to
 Use IN to select the input with the signal that should be monitored
 Push MIX. The input level LEDs start to flash
 Use SELECT to choose between left, right or both channels
 Turn the encoder to set the actual monitoring level
While the setup is simplified (no panorama available) it is still very efficient and will address most
needs. Also a different input can be mixed onto the same output.
Of the eight ADAT channels only channels 1/2 can be controlled from the Babyface Pro.
All settings are stored within the unit and do not get lost until the next time CC mode or
stand-alone mode is used.
User's Guide Babyface Pro © RME 93
35. Application Examples for Stand-Alone Mode
Here are two examples of setting up and using the Babyface Pro in stand-alone mode.
Universal DA-Converter
Connect the Babyface Pro via SPDIF to your CD-player, MP3 player or whatever device digitally
playing audio at up to 192 kHz. Comfortably adjust the hearing level with the rotary encoder.
Push DIM for a quick mute, and use the internal mixer to send the converted digital input signal
to both XLR and Phones outs.
Analog Microphone Preamp
Activate phantom power if necessary, then set the Mic gain as needed. Set the Babyface Pro to
Master 192 kHz for widest frequency range and lowest delay. Use the internal mixer to send the
analog input signal to the analog outputs – finished. The total delay from the internal AD to DA
conversion is a ridiculous 20 samples, which at 192 kHz is a real 0.1 ms – forget it.
With this setup the analog input signal is amplified to line level, available at 4 individually adjust-
able analog outputs as well as an digital output in either SPDIF or ADAT format. Options galore!
Using EQ in stand-alone mode
The Babyface Pro has neither controls nor memory for the DSP functions. Therefore in stand-
alone mode EQs are not available.
There is a workaround though: when using TotalMix FX under Mac or Windows, and powering
the Babyface Pro with an external power supply, pulling the USB cable will retain the whole cur-
rent state, including EQs activated on all I/Os. Changing input gains and output levels as well as
monitoring volume can be done directly at the unit as usual. This ‘online’ state gets lost the mo-
ment the unit loses power, it then enters the normal ‘offline’ stand-alone mode as stored in its
memory (last usage in full stand-alone mode), and of course without EQs.
36. Useful notes
Mobile Operation
USB bus power can be delivered by a rechargeable battery. These days LiPo batteries with USB
ports are very popular, usually used to charge your mobile gadgets on the go. They are light-
weight, have an astonishing capacity, can be recharged quickly many times, and are not expen-
sive. And they have a USB port. We tried several of those with 4,200 mAh and more. The Baby-
face Pro worked for several hours while playing music, with bigger batteries more than 10 hours.
Batteries from 10,000 mAh and up are also available with 9 to 12 V output. These avoid potential
bus power issues with peak loads over less than optimal USB cables, as they would provide
power to the external power supply connector of the Babyface Pro – and also enable iPad mo-
